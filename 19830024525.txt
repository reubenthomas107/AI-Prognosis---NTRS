DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTILEVEL OPTIMIZATION APPROACH TO THE DESIGN
OF MODERN ENGINEERING SYSTEMS
by
Jean-Francois Marie Barthelemy
(ABSTRACT)
This work describes an optimization approach to the design
of complex engineering systems. The approach assumes a
decomposition of the original problem (design of the system)
into smaller subproblems (design of subsystems) organized in
a multilevel hierarchy. As one goes down the levels, the
details of the system become more precisely defined;
furthermore, each subproblem may control the design of lower
level subproblems.
A general algorithm is proposed which carries out the
design process iteratively, starting at the top of the
hierarchy and proceeding downward. Each subproblem is
optimized separately for fixed controls from higher level
subproblems. 	An optimum sensitivity analysis is then
performed which determines the sensitivity of the subproblem

design to changes in higher level subproblem controls. The
resulting sensitivity derivatives are used to construct
constraints which force the controlling subproblems into
chosing their own designs so as to improve the lower level
subproblem designs while satisfying their own constraints.
The applicability of the proposed algorithm is
demonstrated by devising a four-level hierarchy to perform
the simultaneous aerodynamic and structural design_ of a
high-performance sailplane wing for maximum cross-country
speed.	The levels are devoted successively to selecting
global	performance parameters, 	determining 	the wing
aerodynamic shape, defining the spanwise distributions of
global structural characteristics, 	and, performing the
detailed design of wing substructures.
Finally, the concepts discussed are applied to the two-
level minimum weight structural design of the sailplane
wing. The numerical experiments show that discontinuities
in the sensitivity derivatives may delay convergence, but
that the algorithm is robust enough to overcome these
discontinuities and produce low-weight feasible designs,
regardless of whether the optimization is started from the
feasible space or the infeasible one.

INTRODUCTION
The design of modern engineering systems is a procedure
which often integrates different disciplines and always
involves a large number of variables. While optimization
techniques provide an attractive formal tool for carrying
out the design process, a weakness of these techniques
remains in their inability to handle 	truly large
multidisciplinary design problems. 	To overcome that
weakness, designers must resort to some sort of
decomposition method. The original design problem is broken
down into smaller subproblems which are then optimized
separately. However, these subproblems are generally
coupled so that an iterative scheme must be devised which
coordinates their optimization in order that the resulting
design is, to some extent, optimum with respect to the
original problem.
1.1	OVERVIEW OF EXISTING LITERATURE
Several studies have been devoted to decomposition of large
optimization problems. These studies pertain to all the
areas of engineering as well as economics and management.
The following overview focuses mainly on structuralOF POOR 	 eW
optimization. For the sake of the discussion, two classes
of decomposition methods are defined: formal methods and
intuitive methods. In formal methods, the mathematical
structure of the problem is exploited to arrive at a rigid
decomposition scheme. Consequently, a rigorous framework
exists within which the mathematical properties of the
method may be assessed. In intuitive methods, understanding
of the behavior of the physical system considered is
apparently the prime factor directing the decomposition.
These methods are sometimes referred to as rational methods
and their mathematical characteristics can seldom be studied
in great detail. An intuitive approach provides, of course,
the only option for decomposing those problems which do not
possess the structure for which a formal decomposition
method exists. This division into formal and intuitive
methods is somewhat arbitrary as a given approach may very
well be shown to belong to both classes; however,it
facilitates the discussion.
1.1.1	Formal Decomposition Methods
A very extensive body of work exists on decomposition in
linear programming (LP). The existence of truly large
problems in the fields of economics and operations research
has stimulated efforts aiming at exploiting the specialOF, POOR ft:{rv^ a ^}^^
structures of the constraint matrix. The major initial step
in that area seems to have been the introduction of the
Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle in 1960. By 1970 the
developments in this active field were so numerous as to
warrant the publication of a textbook by Lasdon (Ref. 1).
In the area of structural design, problems involving
collapse design of trusses and frames were solved
successfully using the LP decomposition techniques (Refs.
2-5).
Dynamic programming (DP) was discussed by Bellman as
early as 1957 (Ref. 6). 	It is a decomposition method
suitable for nonlinear problems. The problems must be
serial, that is, of the form such that any change in the
design of one subproblem affects only those subproblems that
are	"downstream" 	in	the	decision-making 	process.
Furthermore, the problem objective function must be
additive. However, DP cannot easily handle constraints that
involve more than one subproblem. Also, it becomes very
expensive if there are large amounts of data transmitted
between successive subproblems. Among the advantages of the
DP method are its capability to generate global optimum
designs and to handle discrete variables and discontinuous
functions. In structural design, dynamic programming seems
to find use in optimization of "one-dimensional" structures,OF POOR QU ? €TV
N
that is, beams, one-bay multistory or one-story multibay
frames, and transmission towers (see Ref. 7 Chap. XI or Ref.
8).
Optimization algorithms were devised for separable
nonlinear problems using coordination techniques developed
in the context of multilevel decision-making processes.
Once a problem has been decomposed into smaller subproblems,
the main task is to coordinate the design of the different
subproblems. Essentially, the subproblems are grouped on
the lower level of a hierarchy and an additional higher
level subproblem is added whose role is to select the values
of coordinating variables so as to force the other
subproblems into choosing designs corresponding to improved
overall problem performance. The coordinating subproblem is
itself cast in the form of an optimization problem. As the
evaluation of the objective function of the coordinating
subproblem requires complete optimization of all lower level
subproblems, this type of algorithm may turn out to be very
expensive. A study of coordination in hierarchical systems
is given in the 1970 monograph by Mesarovic and coauthors
(Ref. 9). Kirsch and coworkers have used both the model
coordination technique and the goal coordination technique
to solve various structural design problems (Ref. 7 Chap. X
and Refs. 10-12)1.1.2	Intuitive Decomposition Methods
The first attempts at developing intuitive decomposition
schemes for large structural design problems were extensions
of the fully stressed design method. In these approaches
the structure is seen as a combination of elements
(substructures). 	Given an initial design for all the
elements, an analysis of the structure is made to determine
inter-element forces. 	Then, each element is optimized
separately on the assumption that changes in that element
design do not change inter-element forces. Once all the
elements have ,been designed, the structure is analyzed again
and the process repeated until convergence is achieved.
Giles (Ref. 13) and Sobieski (Ref. 14) performed the design
of airplane wings under constraints on stresses and element
stability using that approach. Kirsch and coworkers (Ref.
15) designed frameworks using a similar approach but
reanalyzing 	the	structure 	after	each	substructure
optimization, 	in order to account better for load
redistribution.
When optimizing a structure one substructure at a time,
it is difficult to handle global constraints, that is, those
constraints affected by variables belonging to more than one
substructure. In Ref. 16, Sobieski and Loendorf designed
airplane fuselages under local constraints on stresses and6
OF P'^JCR
local instabilities and global constraints on fuselage
elastic displacements. The optimization was first carried
out with the local constraints, as described above. If
necessary, the resulting design was subsequently modified to
satisfy the displacement constraints using a unit load
method to determine the impact that changes in element
design have on the violated displacements. Another example
of treatment of global constraints is given by Hughes and
coworkers (Ref. 17) who designed ship compartments for
minimum cost under constraints on stresses.
A generalized fully stressed design approach to large
problems is certainly economically appealing. However, it
presents two difficulties. As pointed out in Ref. 14
"...minimization of the individual component masses does not
guarantee minimization of the total mass This situation
is caused by the inability to control the load path on the
assembled structure level... ." As mentioned earlier also,
it makes it difficult to handle global constraints. 	In
Refs. 18 and 19 Schmit and coworkers used a two-level
approach to design trusses and aircraft wings. At the
global level, the distributions of stiffnesses, the global
level variables, were chosen so as to minimize the total
structural weight, while satisfying global displacement
constraints and also some local constraints on stresses andORIGINA L PAGE @S 	7
OF POOR QUALITY
structural element buckling. For known stiffnesses, the end
forces on the various structural elements were calculated.
At the local level, these structural elements were optimized
separately with respect to their detail design, the local
level variables, so that the changes in element stiffnesses
were minimized, while the local constraints were still
satisfied. The process was repeated until convergence was
achieved. In this decomposition, the introduction of the
global level problem was a key factor in overcoming both
difficulties . attributed to the generalized fully stressed
design approach. By placing the minimization of the weight
at the global level, the opportunity was kept to trade
structural mass between the elements in order to improve the
load paths while reducing the total weight. 	Also, the
provision was left to explicitly handle global constraints.
1.1.3	General Approach to Engineering System Design
The intuitive decomposition methods discussed to this point
are very specific and cannot easily be extended to different
classes of problems. In particular, they are not suited for
multidisciplinary problems. In Ref. 20, Sobieski proposed a
general approach to the design of large engineering systems,
and in Ref. 21, he proceeded to demonstrate the proposed
concepts by applying them to the two-level minimum weight8	 ORIGINAL RAGE IS
OF POOR QUALITY
design of a portal framework under local constraints on
stresses and local buckling and global constraints on
displacement. At the global level, the weight of the
framework is minimized with respect to the cross-sectional
area and bending moment of inertia of the different beams,
while satisfying constraints on displacements. Once a
global design is obtained, the framework is analyzed to
obtain the end loads on the beams. At the local level, each
beam is designed separately. Its detailed dimensions are
proportioned so as achieve the values of cross-sectional
area and bending moment of inertia chosen at the global
level while satisfying constraints on stresses and local
buckling. 	This is done by minimizing a measure of the
violation of the subproblem constraints. An optimum
sensitivity analysis (Ref. 22) is then performed in order to
obtain a linear approximation to the constraint violation of
each local level subproblem in terms of the global level
variables. The whole optimization is repeated, but, at the
global level, it is required that the (linearized) local
level constraint violations be reduced. This iterative
process is pursued until all the local and global level
constraints are satisfied and the framework weight cannot be
reduced further. Although the proposed scheme is applied to
a structural synthesis problem, it is applicable to any typeOt;i 	 L	r,

of engineering design. Furthermore, it may be used with
decompositions involving more than two levels. Some of the
key features of the approach are discussed below.
The method postulates a multilevel decomposition of the
problem, that is, a decomposition where the different
subproblems are grouped on the levels of a hierarchy. The
subproblem at the top level is concerned with the
optimization of the overall system objective in terms of
design variables describing that system in very global
terms. As one proceeds down the hierarchy, the subproblems
are dealing wi~h subsystems described in deeper and deeper
levels of detail. The choice of the specifics of the
decomposition for a given application still remains largely
a matter of physical insight and convenience.
Below the highest level, each subproblem is concerned
with finding a set of design variables which satisfy its own
constraints for fixed values of higher level variables. It
turns out that this amounts to finding a design vector which
satisfies a set of equality constraints and a set of
inequality constraints. Such a mathematical problem may not
have a solution. It may be transformed into a mathematical
programming problem which maximizes a measure of "how well"
the design satisfies the sets of constraints. The
subproblem formulation of Ref. 21 uses the equality10
ORIGINAL PAGE 19
OF POOR QUALITY
constraints to eliminate dependent variables and forms a
penalty function with the inequality constraints. That
penalty function is a measure of constraint violation which
is then minimized with respect to the independent variables
to find that design which best meets the constraints.
Once designs are obtained for all the subproblems on a
given level, sensitivity analyses are performed to determine
the effect changes in higher level variables have on lower
level constraint violations. The resulting sensitivity
derivatives are used to construct linear approximations to
the lower subproblem constraint violations in terms of the
higher level design variables. 	These approximations are
added as constraints for the next optimization of the higher
level subproblems. This enables the optimization of the
higher level subproblems to be conducted so as to improve
the design of the lower level subproblems which have
violated constraints or so as to reduce the margin of
satisfaction for those subproblems for which all constraints
are amply satisfied. In essence, this makes the trade-offs
between the different subproblems visible and allows them to
be resolved in a rational fashion.
The task of the highest level subproblem remains the
optimization of the system performance index with respect to
its own global variables which are required not only toI= POOR QUALITY
satisfy its own constraints but also to reduce the
constraint violation for the lower level subproblems.
1.2	OUTLINE
The purpose of this work has been to investigate the
applicability of Sobieski's method to the design of complex,
multidisciplinary engineering systems. It was elected to
focus the effort on a specific example: the simultaneous
aerodynamic and structural design of a high-performance
sailplane wing for maximum cross-country speed. 	It was
determined that this design problem could be carried out by
means of a four-level decomposition. An algorithm was
developed to solve the problem and it was tested on the two
lower levels of the decomposition.
In Chapter II, we discuss the optimum sensitivity
analysis technique. We show that the stationary conditions
satisfied at a local constrained optimum may be used to
determine the sensitivity of optimum objective functions and
design variables to changes in those parameters that were
kept fixed during the optimization.
Chapter III is devoted to a detailed description of the
proposed algorithm. It is constructed along the same lines
as that described in Ref. 20. The main difference resides
with the specifics of the mathematical formulation for the12
OF pOOR QUALITY
individual subproblems. The present algorithm treats
equality constraints in a general numerical fashion.
Furthermore, it is designed as a constrained programming
problem rather than as a penalty function minimization
problem. Particular attention is paid to the potential
difficulties associated with decompositions that involve
more than two levels.
In Chapter IV, the decomposition proposed for the example
problem is detailed. It is a four-level decomposition. The
highest level subproblem entails selection of global
performance parameters which include weight and aerodynamic
characteristics. Then follows an aerodynamic subproblem
where the shape of the wing is defined so as to obtain the
aerodynamic characteristics specified in the performance
subproblem and control the initiation bf stall. On the
third level of the decomposition is a global structural
subproblem where the wing -spanwise distributions of weight
and stiffnesses are selected for fixed total weight and so
as to limit the wing bending response and torsional
divergence speed. Finally, at the lowest level, the wing is
modeled by a series of spanwise elements each of which is
designed separately for fixed weight and stiffnesses under
stress and local buckling constraints.
sl13
In Chapter V, the algorithm introduced in Chap. III is
applied to the two lower levels of the hierarchy described
in Chap. IV. The problem solved is the minimum weight
design of a straight composite wing. Results are given for
designs started from both the feasible space and the
infeasible space.
Finally, Chapter VI is devoted to synthesizing the
experience gained with this work and making recommendations
for continued investigation.OF POOR QJHLi d V

SUMMARY OF PERTINENT RESULTS FROM OPTIMUM
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Optimum sensitivity analysis is a technique which permits
one to investigate the sensitivity of the solution of an
optimization problem to variations in the parameters of the
problem. It yields derivatives of the optimum values of the
design variables and objective function with respect to the
parameters, derivatives which may then be used to perform
trade-off analyses. These derivatives are called
sensitivity derivatives to distinguish them from the
derivatives of objective function and constraints with
respect to the design variables which are termed behavior
derivatives. 	This technique was recently introduced by
Sobieski and coauthors (Ref. 22) as a tool for structural
synthesis. It has been specialized by Schmit and Chang
(Ref. 23) to a formulation of the problem of structural
sizing for mimimum weight based on approximation concepts
and dual methods, and has been used by Haftka (Ref.  24 ) in
the optimization of damage tolerant structures. The
elements of the technique required for the remainder of this
work are discussed in this chapter; the reader interested in
a more general discussion should consult Ref. 22.

superscript a refers to the constraints exactly satisfied
(active) at the local minimum (there are m a such constraints
and g  is a subvector of g); finally, X is the vector of
Lagrange multipliers (dual variables). The object of
optimum sensitivity analysis is to find the rates of change
of F and X with respect to P. We define these rates of
changes as follows
X' = dX	(matrix, nxk components)

The two following sections are devoted to calculating F' and
X'.
2.2	SENSITIVITY DERIVATIVES OF THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
The optimum sensitivity derivative of the objective function
is obtained by the chain rule of differentiation as
F' = FP+X' TFx	(2.6)OF POOR QUALITY
where subscript p indicates partial derivatives with respect
to vector P. Now, we can show that F' may be found without
actually calculating X'. We require that the optimum point
for P+AP remain at the intersection of the constraints
determining the optimum point for P. Hence, the second of
Eqs. 2.3 is stationary with respect to P,
,_(,a*) = gp*+ga*X' = 0	(2.7)
*Combining Eq. 2.7 transposed and postmultiplied by a and
the first of Eqs. 2.3 premultiplied by X' T, we obtain
X'TFx = 9a*T a*	 (2.8)
or
F' = Fp+,a*T a *	(2.9)
*The Lagrange multipliers a may be available as by-products
of the optimization scheme; otherwise, they may be obtained
by QR decomposition or from the more classical least-squares
solution to the first of Eqs. 2.3,

Then, Eq. 2.9 yields F' directly. 	An alternate solution
exists because Eq. 2.7 is the only condition that X' must18	AV PP.Gr ts

meet in order for Eq. 2.8 to be satisfied. 	Therefore, if
for some matrix Y (nxk)
ga*+ga*Y = 0	 (2.11)p x
then
X'TF = ga*Ta* = YTF x	p	x
and
F' = Fp+YTFx	(2.12)
Equation 2.11 represents k sets of m a linear equations in n
unknowns, with m a <_ n. We may therefore give arbitrary
values to n-m a components of each column of Y and deduce the
remaining m a components from Eq. 2.11. In general, Y
differs from the true sensitivity derivatives of the
variables X' , unless n = m a. Assume that, in the space of
the design variables X, an infinitesimal perturbation of
parameter P results in a move from the initial point in the
direction specified by Y. Then, the resulting design is
still at the intersection of the originally active
constraints because condition 2.7 is enforced; however, it
may not be optimum because the first of Eqs. 2.3 may not be
satisfied any more.

The approach of Sec. 2.2 yields the exact value of F' at
considerably lower cost than that of Sec. 2.3 since it
involves only first-order partial derivatives of F and q 
with respect to the design variables and parameters of the
problem. However, it does not usually permit one to obtain
X' (unless n = m a). The choice between the two types of
analysis is very much dependent on the application
considered and the nature of the optimization problem at
hand. It must be guided by a comparison between the cost of
calculating second-order partial derivatives of F and g  on
the one hand, and the benefit of knowing the sensitivity
derivatives of the variables on the other hand.
It must be noted that higher order sensitivity
derivatives may be obtained for X F and X by setting
higher order total derivatives of the two first stationary
conditions (Eqs. 2.3) to zero. In particular, Ref. 25 shows
how little additional calculation is required to find F",
once X' has been obtained.
2.4	ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
After solving a mathematical programming problem and
before performing sensitivity analysis, it is necessary to
find the set of the active constraints. These constraints
must satisfy Eqs. 2.3; furthermore, their gradients must be21QF:i zrr',AL! el-- y N:^

linearly independent, if one wants to obtain the Lagrange
multipliers from Eq. 2.10. The algorithm described below
was used with success.
i)Select an initial set S  of nearly satisfied
constraints by retaining those constraints whose
value is above a small negative tolerance.
ii)Identify S pa, the subset of S a which contains the
maximum number of constraints with independent
gradients. To achieve that, the constraint
gradients are taken as the columns of a rectangular
matrix and a Gaussian elimination with row and
column interchanges is performed to identify the
independent columns.
iii)Use Eq. 2.10 to find the Lagrange multipliers
corresponding to set S pa. Note that the fact that
the constraints of set Spa have independent
gradients is a guarantee that Eq. 2.10 has a
solution.
iv)Find the smallest Lagrange multiplier ai.
V)	If X. is negative (less than a small positive
tolerance), eliminate constraint i from set S  and
restart the process in ii). 	If X  is positive,
terminate the process since S'a is the desired set.22	'3F ? DR U` F_:
Note that steps ii) and iii) would not be required if QR
decomposition were used. In step v), only the constraints
with strictly positive Lagrange multipliers are kept, even
though active constraints may have Lagrange multipliers that
are zero. This is because constraints with zero Lagrange
multipliers are redundant; hence, their gradients are
linearly dependent on other constraint gradients.
In this work, the sensitivity derivatives are used to
extend optimization information over a range of variation
for the parameters of the design problems considered. This
is achieved by means of the linear extrapolations given in
Eq. 2.5. The implicit relationships 2.2 are expected to be
nonlinear, in general. Hence, the extrapolations being
first-order Taylor series expansions, they are valid only
for limited AP. Furthermore, the calculation of the
sensitivity derivatives is based on the assumption that the
set of constraints active at the initial optimum will remain
unchanged as the parameter P is changed to P+AP.
Perturbations of the parameters cause moves of the
constraint boundaries with respect to each other and,
therefore, may very well result in changes in the active
constraint set. These changes then imply reduced accuracy
of the extrapolated optima. The question arises of whether
it is possible to estimate the magnitude of the parameterOF POOR QvA° ITY
perturbations which cause changes in the active constraint
set. It was proposed in Ref. 22 that the perturbation of
parameter p (element of vector P) which results in
constraint i changing from active status to inactive status
may be obtained to the first order by stating that X  is
reduced to zero when constraint i leaves the active set,
Xi(P+APi) _ Xi(P)+Xi(P)APi = 0
or
Opi = -ai(P)/Xi(P)	(2.15)
Reference 22 likewise suggested that the perturbation of
parameter p causing constraint i to change from inactive
status to active status could be found as that value ep i for
which gi(p+Api) becomes zero.
gi(P+APi) = gi(P)+1gix(P)X'(P)1APi = 0
then
APi= -gi(P)/Igix( P)X'(P))	(2.16)
It was observed in Ref. 26 that Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 could be
unreliable. These estimates were used to determine with a
specific design problem example what parameter perturbations
cause changes in the status of the different constraints247^ "n
OF POOR QJAUTY
involved, attempting so to speak, to construct an history
of the active constraint set as p varies. This may not be
an appropriate approach. Indeed, Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 may be
used to estimate a Ap i for each of the problem constraints,
indicating when the status of a particular constraint is
supposed to change. However, only the smallest (in absolute
value) negative and positive of these dp i (Ap_ and 4p+)
should be taken into consideration. The extrapolations
based on sensitivity derivatives obtained at p should be
adequate for p+Ap - < p+pp 5 p+pp +, But any prediction
beyond that range (in particular prediction of change in the
active constraint set) should not be relied upon since it
would have been obtained with derivatives corresponding to
an inappropriate active constraint set. In essence, as
suggested in Ref. 23, the Ap i of Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 must be
regarded as bounds on Op. Barring excessive nonlinearity,
the range of ep defined by the intersection of these bounds
is that within which the extrapolations based on sensitivity
derivatives calculated at p should be reliable. 	In the
absence of changes in the active constraint set, the
accuracy of Eq. 	2.5 is limited only by the inherent
nonlinearity of the specific design problem considered.
Experiments conducted with various structural design
problems showed (Ref. 22) that linear-extrapolation-based25
N
estimates of optimum objective functions and design
variables fell within a few percent of actual optimization
result, for parameter variations of up to twenty percent;
the predictions often were better for the objective function
than for the design variables.(n^ niece,.

PRESENTATION OF THE ALGORITHM
This chapter is devoted to discussing an algorithm proposed
for the design of complex engineering systems. The method
is based on multilevel decomposition of the corresponding
design problems 	into	subproblems 	which	are	solved
separately. 	The algorithm is discussed in general terms.
This is done so as to avoid focusing on a particular
problem. 	The following chapter will be devoted to
investigating the applicability of the approach described
here to a specific problem. 	The abstract concepts
introduced here can be more easily put in a physical context
if this chapter and the following one are read
simultaneously. The presentation begins with a definition
of the type of multilevel decomposition considered and of
the components of that decomposition. Then, the discussion
centers on the formulation and solution of the subproblems.
Finally, the organization of the overall optimization is
discussed. 	The developments follow those by Sobieski in
Ref. 20.

3.1	DEFINITIONS
The starting point of this discussion is the task of
designing a system by finding a set of variables which
optimize a performance index while satisfying a number of
constraints. This will be referred to as the
overall problem. Assume that, for convenience, the overall
problem is decomposed into a number of subproblems, each of
which corresponds to the design of a subsystem, and has its
own sets of variables and constraints. The subproblems are
organized in a hierarchy as shown on Fig. 1. The subproblem
at the top of the hierarchy is the design of the whole
system, in very general terms. The next level deals with
major subsystems, the third one with subsystems of the major
subsystems, and so on. As one goes down the levels, the
details of the system become more and more precisely
defined. The subproblems are identified by two numbers ij
which define (i) the level of the subproblem, and (j) its
position on that level. 	The level numbers increase
downward, and the subproblem numbers increase, say, from
left to right. The hierarchy is assumed to have 1 levels,
there are n  subproblems on level i.
The whole design process is conducted iteratively,
starting at the highest level and going down. 	Each
subsystem is designed separately. 	The object of the
algorithm is to coordinate the design of the different28

subsystems so as to obtain optimum system performance by
resolving the trade-offs between the subsystems in a
rational fashion. This is achieved by manipulating two
types of interactions between the subproblems: the controls
and the responses. A control is a quantity selected in a
subproblem to influence another subproblem in the hierarchy.
A response is a quantity that reflects the effect the design
of one subproblem has on that of another subproblem. In
this work, we assume that the controls flow exclusively
downward in the hierarchy, while the responses flow
exclusively upward. This excludes situations where a
subproblem controls another subproblem on the same level
(lateral control) or on a higher level (reverse control).'
As represented symbolically on Fig. 2, each subproblem is
assumed to receive controls from higher level subproblems
through vector CI ij (control inputs in subproblem if), and
to receive responses from lower level subproblems through
vector RIij (response inputs in subproblem i1). Also, each
subproblem is assumed to control lower level subproblems
with vector COij (control outputs from subproblem i^), and
' In Ref. 20, the controls are named interaction quantities.
The interested reader should refer to that source for
indications as to how to handle reverse and lateral
controls.c) Highest level subproblem.

to respond to higher level subproblems with vector ROij
(response outputs from subproblem ice). This discussion does
not make any assumption on the specific form of the
controls, except that the control outputs from a subproblem
depend on the variables of that subproblem; they may be the
variables themselves or functions of these variables (CO .j =i
Coij(Xij)). Likewise, the controls imposed on subproblem ij
(CI ij) are not specified , except that they are assumed
known once all the control outputs from higher level
subproblems (Co ri, a<i) are known. The response outputs
from a subproblem (RO ij) will be defined in this chapter.
Furthermore, it will be shown that the response inputs into
a subproblem (RI ij) are entirely known once the response
outputs from the lower level subproblems (RO as, a>i) are
known.
For each iteration of the overall system, each subproblem
is concerned with finding a design which satisfies its own
constraints for the controls specified by the higher level
subproblems (CI ij). In addition, the subproblem manipulates
its own controls (CO..) so as to improve the responses from
the lower level subproblems (RI ij ).	Mathematically, this
implies finding a design vector that satisfies a set of0"KY A p P cn- n
32	OF POOR QUALITY
equality constraints and a set of inequality constraints.
This problem may be solved by transforming it into a
nonlinear mathematical programming problem where a measure
of constraint violation is minimized with respect to the
design vector. The subproblem's own response (RO ij) is then
constituted of the minimum measure of constraint violation
as well as derivatives indicating the sensitivity of that
minimum measure to changes in the controls imposed on the
subproblem.
The subproblem on the highest level of the hierarchy
drives the whole design process. It selects its own design
variables so as to optimize the overall problem performance
index and satisfy its own constraints. It adjusts its
controls (CO 11) to improve the responses from the lower
levels (RI 11), that is, reduce the constraint violation in
the lower level subproblems.
3.2 	 LOWEST LEVEL SUBPROBLEM
Figure 2 a) describes symbolically subproblem lj, a
subproblem on the lowest level of the hierarchy. The vector
of design variables is X lj, the subproblem design is
influenced by the controls collected in vector CI lj and the
subproblem response is vector RO lj.	The subproblem

The functions g lj and elj are vector-valued. The subproblem
design is subject to a set of inequality constraints (Eq.
3.1.a). These are the constraints set on the corresponding
subsystem in the statement of the overall non-decomposed
problem. The design is also subject to a set of equality
constraints (Eq. 3.1.b). Some of these may come from the
formulation of the overall non-decomposed problem; some are
imposed on the subproblem during decomposition. The
multilevel decomposition consists of different models of the
system being designed, the models becoming more refined as
one progresses down the hierarchy. The equality constraints
arise from the necessity of requiring consistency between
the models at different levels. Also, some upper and lower
bounds may be set on the variables (Eq. 3.1.c). As stated
in the previous section, the subproblem is assumed to be
controlled by each subproblem on the higher levels. As a
result, the vector of controls CI lj is functionally
dependent on the optimum designs of all the subproblems

replaced by two inequality constraints (Eq. 3.3.c). The
distance between these constraints (2n ij ) is forced to
remain positive because of Eq. 3.3.e and to decrease because
of the second term in the objective function. 	Each
inequality constraint is relaxed by the addition of variable
E: mechanism of that relaxation is described in Fig.
3, for a simple two-dimensional problem with one equality
and three inequality constraints, assuming that the equality
constraint is identically satisfied. The first term in the
objective function (Eq. 3.3.a) is defined so as to increase
Eli . A high positive value for Eli is quite acceptable as
it means that the selected design point is deep inside the
feasible domain, away from the constraint boundaries, and
that decreases the chances of obtaining infeasible designs
when the controls are perturbed. If the solution of Problem
3.3 is so that Eli z 0 and Ti lj = 0, then it solves Problem
3.1. If, on the other hand, we have Elj < 0 or Ti lj x 0,
then the resulting design is infeasible with respect to
Problem 3.1.
Constant b is added to the definition of the objective

the different constraints. A high value for b results in a
heavy penalty paid for violating equality constraints;
conversely, a low value for b makes the penalty for
violating inequality constraints more important, in relative
terms. In addition to adjusting b, it may prove appropriate
to scale variables E1j and n1j in order to make all
components of the constraint gradients of the same order of
magnitude.
Any nonlinear programming algorithm may be used to solve
Problem 3.3. 	This yields X lj, as well as a measure of
inequality constraint violation E1j and a measure of
equality constraint violation n1j. These are functionally
dependent on the controls CI 1j and, therefore, as indicated
by Eq. 3.2, on the optimum design variables of subproblems
on higher levels. Optimum sensitivity analysis may be used
to study the effect changes in higher level subproblem
variables have on the constraint violations for subproblem
lj.	Considering £1j, if all higher level subproblem

DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTILEVEL OPTIMIZATION APPROACH TO THE DESIGN

by
Jean-Francois Marie Barthelemy
(ABSTRACT)
This work describes an optimization approach to the design
of complex engineering systems. The approach assumes a
decomposition of the original problem (design of the system)
into smaller subproblems (design of subsystems) organized in
a multilevel hierarchy. As one goes down the levels, the
details of the system become more precisely defined;
furthermore, each subproblem may control the design of lower
level subproblems.
A general algorithm is proposed which carries out the
design process iteratively, starting at the top of the
hierarchy and proceeding downward. Each subproblem is
optimized separately for fixed controls from higher level
subproblems. 	An optimum sensitivity analysis is then
performed which determines the sensitivity of the subproblem

design to changes in higher level subproblem controls. The
resulting sensitivity derivatives are used to construct
constraints which force the controlling subproblems into
chosing their own designs so as to improve the lower level
subproblem designs while satisfying their own constraints.
The applicability of the proposed algorithm is
demonstrated by devising a four-level hierarchy to perform
the simultaneous aerodynamic and structural design_ of a
high-performance sailplane wing for maximum cross-country
speed.	The levels are devoted successively to selecting
global	performance parameters, 	determining 	the wing
aerodynamic shape, defining the spanwise distributions of
global structural characteristics, 	and, performing the
detailed design of wing substructures.
Finally, the concepts discussed are applied to the two-
level minimum weight structural design of the sailplane
wing. The numerical experiments show that discontinuities
in the sensitivity derivatives may delay convergence, but
that the algorithm is robust enough to overcome these
discontinuities and produce low-weight feasible designs,
regardless of whether the optimization is started from the
feasible space or the infeasible one.

Chapter I
INTRODUCTION
The design of modern engineering systems is a procedure
which often integrates different disciplines and always
involves a large number of variables. While optimization
techniques provide an attractive formal tool for carrying
out the design process, a weakness of these techniques
remains in their inability to handle 	truly large
multidisciplinary design problems. 	To overcome that
weakness, designers must resort to some sort of
decomposition method. The original design problem is broken
down into smaller subproblems which are then optimized
separately. However, these subproblems are generally
coupled so that an iterative scheme must be devised which
coordinates their optimization in order that the resulting
design is, to some extent, optimum with respect to the
original problem.
1.1	OVERVIEW OF EXISTING LITERATURE
Several studies have been devoted to decomposition of large
optimization problems. These studies pertain to all the
areas of engineering as well as economics and management.
The following overview focuses mainly on structuralOF POOR 	 eW
optimization. For the sake of the discussion, two classes
of decomposition methods are defined: formal methods and
intuitive methods. In formal methods, the mathematical
structure of the problem is exploited to arrive at a rigid
decomposition scheme. Consequently, a rigorous framework
exists within which the mathematical properties of the
method may be assessed. In intuitive methods, understanding
of the behavior of the physical system considered is
apparently the prime factor directing the decomposition.
These methods are sometimes referred to as rational methods
and their mathematical characteristics can seldom be studied
in great detail. An intuitive approach provides, of course,
the only option for decomposing those problems which do not
possess the structure for which a formal decomposition
method exists. This division into formal and intuitive
methods is somewhat arbitrary as a given approach may very
well be shown to belong to both classes; however,it
facilitates the discussion.
1.1.1	Formal Decomposition Methods
A very extensive body of work exists on decomposition in
linear programming (LP). The existence of truly large
problems in the fields of economics and operations research
has stimulated efforts aiming at exploiting the specialOF, POOR ft:{rv^ a ^}^^
structures of the constraint matrix. The major initial step
in that area seems to have been the introduction of the
Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle in 1960. By 1970 the
developments in this active field were so numerous as to
warrant the publication of a textbook by Lasdon (Ref. 1).
In the area of structural design, problems involving
collapse design of trusses and frames were solved
successfully using the LP decomposition techniques (Refs.
2-5).
Dynamic programming (DP) was discussed by Bellman as
early as 1957 (Ref. 6). 	It is a decomposition method
suitable for nonlinear problems. The problems must be
serial, that is, of the form such that any change in the
design of one subproblem affects only those subproblems that
are	"downstream" 	in	the	decision-making 	process.
Furthermore, the problem objective function must be
additive. However, DP cannot easily handle constraints that
involve more than one subproblem. Also, it becomes very
expensive if there are large amounts of data transmitted
between successive subproblems. Among the advantages of the
DP method are its capability to generate global optimum
designs and to handle discrete variables and discontinuous
functions. In structural design, dynamic programming seems
to find use in optimization of "one-dimensional" structures,OF POOR QU ? €TV
N
that is, beams, one-bay multistory or one-story multibay
frames, and transmission towers (see Ref. 7 Chap. XI or Ref.
8).
Optimization algorithms were devised for separable
nonlinear problems using coordination techniques developed
in the context of multilevel decision-making processes.
Once a problem has been decomposed into smaller subproblems,
the main task is to coordinate the design of the different
subproblems. Essentially, the subproblems are grouped on
the lower level of a hierarchy and an additional higher
level subproblem is added whose role is to select the values
of coordinating variables so as to force the other
subproblems into choosing designs corresponding to improved
overall problem performance. The coordinating subproblem is
itself cast in the form of an optimization problem. As the
evaluation of the objective function of the coordinating
subproblem requires complete optimization of all lower level
subproblems, this type of algorithm may turn out to be very
expensive. A study of coordination in hierarchical systems
is given in the 1970 monograph by Mesarovic and coauthors
(Ref. 9). Kirsch and coworkers have used both the model
coordination technique and the goal coordination technique
to solve various structural design problems (Ref. 7 Chap. X
and Refs. 10-12)1.1.2	Intuitive Decomposition Methods
The first attempts at developing intuitive decomposition
schemes for large structural design problems were extensions
of the fully stressed design method. In these approaches
the structure is seen as a combination of elements
(substructures). 	Given an initial design for all the
elements, an analysis of the structure is made to determine
inter-element forces. 	Then, each element is optimized
separately on the assumption that changes in that element
design do not change inter-element forces. Once all the
elements have ,been designed, the structure is analyzed again
and the process repeated until convergence is achieved.
Giles (Ref. 13) and Sobieski (Ref. 14) performed the design
of airplane wings under constraints on stresses and element
stability using that approach. Kirsch and coworkers (Ref.
15) designed frameworks using a similar approach but
reanalyzing 	the	structure 	after	each	substructure
optimization, 	in order to account better for load
redistribution.
When optimizing a structure one substructure at a time,
it is difficult to handle global constraints, that is, those
constraints affected by variables belonging to more than one
substructure. In Ref. 16, Sobieski and Loendorf designed
airplane fuselages under local constraints on stresses and6
OF P'^JCR
local instabilities and global constraints on fuselage
elastic displacements. The optimization was first carried
out with the local constraints, as described above. If
necessary, the resulting design was subsequently modified to
satisfy the displacement constraints using a unit load
method to determine the impact that changes in element
design have on the violated displacements. Another example
of treatment of global constraints is given by Hughes and
coworkers (Ref. 17) who designed ship compartments for
minimum cost under constraints on stresses.
A generalized fully stressed design approach to large
problems is certainly economically appealing. However, it
presents two difficulties. As pointed out in Ref. 14
"...minimization of the individual component masses does not
guarantee minimization of the total mass This situation
is caused by the inability to control the load path on the
assembled structure level... ." As mentioned earlier also,
it makes it difficult to handle global constraints. 	In
Refs. 18 and 19 Schmit and coworkers used a two-level
approach to design trusses and aircraft wings. At the
global level, the distributions of stiffnesses, the global
level variables, were chosen so as to minimize the total
structural weight, while satisfying global displacement
constraints and also some local constraints on stresses andORIGINA L PAGE @S 	7
OF POOR QUALITY
structural element buckling. For known stiffnesses, the end
forces on the various structural elements were calculated.
At the local level, these structural elements were optimized
separately with respect to their detail design, the local
level variables, so that the changes in element stiffnesses
were minimized, while the local constraints were still
satisfied. The process was repeated until convergence was
achieved. In this decomposition, the introduction of the
global level problem was a key factor in overcoming both
difficulties . attributed to the generalized fully stressed
design approach. By placing the minimization of the weight
at the global level, the opportunity was kept to trade
structural mass between the elements in order to improve the
load paths while reducing the total weight. 	Also, the
provision was left to explicitly handle global constraints.
1.1.3	General Approach to Engineering System Design
The intuitive decomposition methods discussed to this point
are very specific and cannot easily be extended to different
classes of problems. In particular, they are not suited for
multidisciplinary problems. In Ref. 20, Sobieski proposed a
general approach to the design of large engineering systems,
and in Ref. 21, he proceeded to demonstrate the proposed
concepts by applying them to the two-level minimum weight8	 ORIGINAL RAGE IS
OF POOR QUALITY
design of a portal framework under local constraints on
stresses and local buckling and global constraints on
displacement. At the global level, the weight of the
framework is minimized with respect to the cross-sectional
area and bending moment of inertia of the different beams,
while satisfying constraints on displacements. Once a
global design is obtained, the framework is analyzed to
obtain the end loads on the beams. At the local level, each
beam is designed separately. Its detailed dimensions are
proportioned so as achieve the values of cross-sectional
area and bending moment of inertia chosen at the global
level while satisfying constraints on stresses and local
buckling. 	This is done by minimizing a measure of the
violation of the subproblem constraints. An optimum
sensitivity analysis (Ref. 22) is then performed in order to
obtain a linear approximation to the constraint violation of
each local level subproblem in terms of the global level
variables. The whole optimization is repeated, but, at the
global level, it is required that the (linearized) local
level constraint violations be reduced. This iterative
process is pursued until all the local and global level
constraints are satisfied and the framework weight cannot be
reduced further. Although the proposed scheme is applied to
a structural synthesis problem, it is applicable to any typeOt;i 	 L	r,	
9
OF POOP QUALITY
of engineering design. Furthermore, it may be used with
decompositions involving more than two levels. Some of the
key features of the approach are discussed below.
The method postulates a multilevel decomposition of the
problem, that is, a decomposition where the different
subproblems are grouped on the levels of a hierarchy. The
subproblem at the top level is concerned with the
optimization of the overall system objective in terms of
design variables describing that system in very global
terms. As one proceeds down the hierarchy, the subproblems
are dealing wi~h subsystems described in deeper and deeper
levels of detail. The choice of the specifics of the
decomposition for a given application still remains largely
a matter of physical insight and convenience.
Below the highest level, each subproblem is concerned
with finding a set of design variables which satisfy its own
constraints for fixed values of higher level variables. It
turns out that this amounts to finding a design vector which
satisfies a set of equality constraints and a set of
inequality constraints. Such a mathematical problem may not
have a solution. It may be transformed into a mathematical
programming problem which maximizes a measure of "how well"
the design satisfies the sets of constraints. The
subproblem formulation of Ref. 21 uses the equality10
ORIGINAL PAGE 19
OF POOR QUALITY
constraints to eliminate dependent variables and forms a
penalty function with the inequality constraints. That
penalty function is a measure of constraint violation which
is then minimized with respect to the independent variables
to find that design which best meets the constraints.
Once designs are obtained for all the subproblems on a
given level, sensitivity analyses are performed to determine
the effect changes in higher level variables have on lower
level constraint violations. The resulting sensitivity
derivatives are used to construct linear approximations to
the lower subproblem constraint violations in terms of the
higher level design variables. 	These approximations are
added as constraints for the next optimization of the higher
level subproblems. This enables the optimization of the
higher level subproblems to be conducted so as to improve
the design of the lower level subproblems which have
violated constraints or so as to reduce the margin of
satisfaction for those subproblems for which all constraints
are amply satisfied. In essence, this makes the trade-offs
between the different subproblems visible and allows them to
be resolved in a rational fashion.
The task of the highest level subproblem remains the
optimization of the system performance index with respect to
its own global variables which are required not only toI= POOR QUALITY
satisfy its own constraints but also to reduce the
constraint violation for the lower level subproblems.
1.2	OUTLINE
The purpose of this work has been to investigate the
applicability of Sobieski's method to the design of complex,
multidisciplinary engineering systems. It was elected to
focus the effort on a specific example: the simultaneous
aerodynamic and structural design of a high-performance
sailplane wing for maximum cross-country speed. 	It was
determined that this design problem could be carried out by
means of a four-level decomposition. An algorithm was
developed to solve the problem and it was tested on the two
lower levels of the decomposition.
In Chapter II, we discuss the optimum sensitivity
analysis technique. We show that the stationary conditions
satisfied at a local constrained optimum may be used to
determine the sensitivity of optimum objective functions and
design variables to changes in those parameters that were
kept fixed during the optimization.
Chapter III is devoted to a detailed description of the

as that described in Ref. 20. The main difference resides
with the specifics of the mathematical formulation for the12

individual subproblems. The present algorithm treats
equality constraints in a general numerical fashion.
Furthermore, it is designed as a constrained programming
problem rather than as a penalty function minimization
problem. Particular attention is paid to the potential
difficulties associated with decompositions that involve
more than two levels.
In Chapter IV, the decomposition proposed for the example
problem is detailed. It is a four-level decomposition. The
highest level subproblem entails selection of global
performance parameters which include weight and aerodynamic
characteristics. Then follows an aerodynamic subproblem
where the shape of the wing is defined so as to obtain the
aerodynamic characteristics specified in the performance
subproblem and control the initiation bf stall. On the
third level of the decomposition is a global structural
subproblem where the wing -spanwise distributions of weight
and stiffnesses are selected for fixed total weight and so
as to limit the wing bending response and torsional
divergence speed. Finally, at the lowest level, the wing is
modeled by a series of spanwise elements each of which is
designed separately for fixed weight and stiffnesses under
stress and local buckling constraints.

In Chapter V, the algorithm introduced in Chap. III is
applied to the two lower levels of the hierarchy described
in Chap. IV. The problem solved is the minimum weight
design of a straight composite wing. Results are given for
designs started from both the feasible space and the
infeasible space.
Finally, Chapter VI is devoted to synthesizing the
experience gained with this work and making recommendations

SUMMARY OF PERTINENT RESULTS FROM OPTIMUM
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Optimum sensitivity analysis is a technique which permits
one to investigate the sensitivity of the solution of an
optimization problem to variations in the parameters of the
problem. It yields derivatives of the optimum values of the
design variables and objective function with respect to the
parameters, derivatives which may then be used to perform
trade-off analyses. These derivatives are called
sensitivity derivatives to distinguish them from the
derivatives of objective function and constraints with
respect to the design variables which are termed behavior
derivatives. 	This technique was recently introduced by
Sobieski and coauthors (Ref. 22) as a tool for structural
synthesis. It has been specialized by Schmit and Chang
(Ref. 23) to a formulation of the problem of structural
sizing for mimimum weight based on approximation concepts
and dual methods, and has been used by Haftka (Ref.  24 ) in
the optimization of damage tolerant structures. The
elements of the technique required for the remainder of this
work are discussed in this chapter; the reader interested in
a more general discussion should consult Ref. 22.

problem, while vector P contains k parameters that are kept
fixed during the optimization process. The constraint g is
vector-valued, in general; it is assumed here to have m
components. The optimum solution is functionally dependent

quantities

In	these	equations, 	subscript 	x	indicates 	partial
derivatives with respect to the design variables;
superscript a refers to the constraints exactly satisfied
(active) at the local minimum (there are m a such constraints
and g  is a subvector of g); finally, X is the vector of
Lagrange multipliers (dual variables). The object of
optimum sensitivity analysis is to find the rates of change
of F and X with respect to P. We define these rates of
changes as follows
X' = dX	(matrix, nxk components)
dP+
F' = dF	(vector, k components) 	 (2.4)

If F'	and X'	are known, 	we may construct linear
approximations to the solution of Problem (2.1),
F*(P+AP) = F*(P)+F'TAP
X*(P+AP) = X *(P)+X'TAP	(2.5)
The two following sections are devoted to calculating F' and
X'.
2.2	SENSITIVITY DERIVATIVES OF THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
The optimum sensitivity derivative of the objective function
is obtained by the chain rule of differentiation as
F' = FP+X' TFx	(2.6)OF POOR QUALITY
where subscript p indicates partial derivatives with respect
to vector P. Now, we can show that F' may be found without
actually calculating X'. We require that the optimum point
for P+AP remain at the intersection of the constraints
determining the optimum point for P. Hence, the second of
Eqs. 2.3 is stationary with respect to P,
,_(,a*) = gp*+ga*X' = 0	(2.7)
*Combining Eq. 2.7 transposed and postmultiplied by a and
the first of Eqs. 2.3 premultiplied by X' T, we obtain
X'TFx = 9a*T a*	 (2.8)
or
F' = Fp+,a*T a *	(2.9)
*The Lagrange multipliers a may be available as by-products
of the optimization scheme; otherwise, they may be obtained
by QR decomposition or from the more classical least-squares
solution to the first of Eqs. 2.3,
19a*9a*T F

Then, Eq. 2.9 yields F' directly. 	An alternate solution
exists because Eq. 2.7 is the only condition that X' must18	AV PP.Gr ts

meet in order for Eq. 2.8 to be satisfied. 	Therefore, if
for some matrix Y (nxk)
ga*+ga*Y = 0	 (2.11)p x
then
X'TF = ga*Ta* = YTF x	p	x
and
F' = Fp+YTFx	(2.12)
Equation 2.11 represents k sets of m a linear equations in n
unknowns, with m a <_ n. We may therefore give arbitrary
values to n-m a components of each column of Y and deduce the
remaining m a components from Eq. 2.11. In general, Y
differs from the true sensitivity derivatives of the
variables X' , unless n = m a. Assume that, in the space of
the design variables X, an infinitesimal perturbation of
parameter P results in a move from the initial point in the
direction specified by Y. Then, the resulting design is
still at the intersection of the originally active
constraints because condition 2.7 is enforced; however, it
may not be optimum because the first of Eqs. 2.3 may not be
satisfied any more.

The approach of Sec. 2.2 yields the exact value of F' at
considerably lower cost than that of Sec. 2.3 since it
involves only first-order partial derivatives of F and q 
with respect to the design variables and parameters of the
problem. However, it does not usually permit one to obtain
X' (unless n = m a). The choice between the two types of
analysis is very much dependent on the application
considered and the nature of the optimization problem at
hand. It must be guided by a comparison between the cost of
calculating second-order partial derivatives of F and g  on
the one hand, and the benefit of knowing the sensitivity
derivatives of the variables on the other hand.
It must be noted that higher order sensitivity
derivatives may be obtained for X F and X by setting
higher order total derivatives of the two first stationary
conditions (Eqs. 2.3) to zero. In particular, Ref. 25 shows
how little additional calculation is required to find F",
once X' has been obtained.
2.4	ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
After solving a mathematical programming problem and
before performing sensitivity analysis, it is necessary to
find the set of the active constraints. These constraints
must satisfy Eqs. 2.3; furthermore, their gradients must be21QF:i zrr',AL! el-- y N:^

linearly independent, if one wants to obtain the Lagrange
multipliers from Eq. 2.10. The algorithm described below
was used with success.
i)Select an initial set S  of nearly satisfied
constraints by retaining those constraints whose
value is above a small negative tolerance.
ii)Identify S pa, the subset of S a which contains the
maximum number of constraints with independent
gradients. To achieve that, the constraint
gradients are taken as the columns of a rectangular
matrix and a Gaussian elimination with row and
column interchanges is performed to identify the
independent columns.
iii)Use Eq. 2.10 to find the Lagrange multipliers
corresponding to set S pa. Note that the fact that
the constraints of set Spa have independent
gradients is a guarantee that Eq. 2.10 has a
solution.
iv)Find the smallest Lagrange multiplier ai.
V)	If X. is negative (less than a small positive
tolerance), eliminate constraint i from set S  and
restart the process in ii). 	If X  is positive,
terminate the process since S'a is the desired set.22	'3F ? DR U` F_:
Note that steps ii) and iii) would not be required if QR
decomposition were used. In step v), only the constraints
with strictly positive Lagrange multipliers are kept, even
though active constraints may have Lagrange multipliers that
are zero. This is because constraints with zero Lagrange
multipliers are redundant; hence, their gradients are
linearly dependent on other constraint gradients.
In this work, the sensitivity derivatives are used to
extend optimization information over a range of variation
for the parameters of the design problems considered. This
is achieved by means of the linear extrapolations given in
Eq. 2.5. The implicit relationships 2.2 are expected to be
nonlinear, in general. Hence, the extrapolations being
first-order Taylor series expansions, they are valid only
for limited AP. Furthermore, the calculation of the
sensitivity derivatives is based on the assumption that the
set of constraints active at the initial optimum will remain
unchanged as the parameter P is changed to P+AP.
Perturbations of the parameters cause moves of the
constraint boundaries with respect to each other and,
therefore, may very well result in changes in the active
constraint set. These changes then imply reduced accuracy
of the extrapolated optima. The question arises of whether
it is possible to estimate the magnitude of the parameterOF POOR QvA° ITY
perturbations which cause changes in the active constraint
set. It was proposed in Ref. 22 that the perturbation of
parameter p (element of vector P) which results in
constraint i changing from active status to inactive status
may be obtained to the first order by stating that X  is
reduced to zero when constraint i leaves the active set,
Xi(P+APi) _ Xi(P)+Xi(P)APi = 0
or
Opi = -ai(P)/Xi(P)	(2.15)
Reference 22 likewise suggested that the perturbation of
parameter p causing constraint i to change from inactive
status to active status could be found as that value ep i for
which gi(p+Api) becomes zero.
gi(P+APi) = gi(P)+1gix(P)X'(P)1APi = 0
then
APi= -gi(P)/Igix( P)X'(P))	(2.16)
It was observed in Ref. 26 that Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 could be
unreliable. These estimates were used to determine with a
specific design problem example what parameter perturbations
cause changes in the status of the different constraints247^ "n
OF POOR QJAUTY
involved, attempting so to speak, to construct an history
of the active constraint set as p varies. This may not be
an appropriate approach. Indeed, Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 may be
used to estimate a Ap i for each of the problem constraints,
indicating when the status of a particular constraint is
supposed to change. However, only the smallest (in absolute
value) negative and positive of these dp i (Ap_ and 4p+)
should be taken into consideration. The extrapolations
based on sensitivity derivatives obtained at p should be
adequate for p+Ap - < p+pp 5 p+pp +, But any prediction
beyond that range (in particular prediction of change in the
active constraint set) should not be relied upon since it
would have been obtained with derivatives corresponding to
an inappropriate active constraint set. In essence, as
suggested in Ref. 23, the Ap i of Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 must be
regarded as bounds on Op. Barring excessive nonlinearity,
the range of ep defined by the intersection of these bounds
is that within which the extrapolations based on sensitivity
derivatives calculated at p should be reliable. 	In the
absence of changes in the active constraint set, the
accuracy of Eq. 	2.5 is limited only by the inherent
nonlinearity of the specific design problem considered.
Experiments conducted with various structural design
problems showed (Ref. 22) that linear-extrapolation-based25
N
estimates of optimum objective functions and design
variables fell within a few percent of actual optimization
result, for parameter variations of up to twenty percent;
the predictions often were better for the objective function
than for the design variables.(n^ niece,.

PRESENTATION OF THE ALGORITHM
This chapter is devoted to discussing an algorithm proposed
for the design of complex engineering systems. The method
is based on multilevel decomposition of the corresponding
design problems 	into	subproblems 	which	are	solved
separately. 	The algorithm is discussed in general terms.
This is done so as to avoid focusing on a particular
problem. 	The following chapter will be devoted to
investigating the applicability of the approach described
here to a specific problem. 	The abstract concepts
introduced here can be more easily put in a physical context
if this chapter and the following one are read
simultaneously. The presentation begins with a definition
of the type of multilevel decomposition considered and of
the components of that decomposition. Then, the discussion
centers on the formulation and solution of the subproblems.
Finally, the organization of the overall optimization is
discussed. 	The developments follow those by Sobieski in
Ref. 20.

3.1	DEFINITIONS
The starting point of this discussion is the task of
designing a system by finding a set of variables which
optimize a performance index while satisfying a number of
constraints. This will be referred to as the
overall problem. Assume that, for convenience, the overall
problem is decomposed into a number of subproblems, each of
which corresponds to the design of a subsystem, and has its
own sets of variables and constraints. The subproblems are
organized in a hierarchy as shown on Fig. 1. The subproblem
at the top of the hierarchy is the design of the whole
system, in very general terms. The next level deals with
major subsystems, the third one with subsystems of the major
subsystems, and so on. As one goes down the levels, the
details of the system become more and more precisely
defined. The subproblems are identified by two numbers ij
which define (i) the level of the subproblem, and (j) its
position on that level. 	The level numbers increase
downward, and the subproblem numbers increase, say, from
left to right. The hierarchy is assumed to have 1 levels,
there are n  subproblems on level i.
The whole design process is conducted iteratively,
starting at the highest level and going down. 	Each
subsystem is designed separately. 	The object of the
algorithm is to coordinate the design of the different28

subsystems so as to obtain optimum system performance by
resolving the trade-offs between the subsystems in a
rational fashion. This is achieved by manipulating two
types of interactions between the subproblems: the controls
and the responses. A control is a quantity selected in a
subproblem to influence another subproblem in the hierarchy.
A response is a quantity that reflects the effect the design
of one subproblem has on that of another subproblem. In
this work, we assume that the controls flow exclusively
downward in the hierarchy, while the responses flow
exclusively upward. This excludes situations where a
subproblem controls another subproblem on the same level
(lateral control) or on a higher level (reverse control).'
As represented symbolically on Fig. 2, each subproblem is
assumed to receive controls from higher level subproblems
through vector CI ij (control inputs in subproblem if), and
to receive responses from lower level subproblems through
vector RIij (response inputs in subproblem i1). Also, each
subproblem is assumed to control lower level subproblems
with vector COij (control outputs from subproblem i^), and
' In Ref. 20, the controls are named interaction quantities.
The interested reader should refer to that source for
indications as to how to handle reverse and lateral
controls.c) Highest level subproblem.

to respond to higher level subproblems with vector ROij
(response outputs from subproblem ice). This discussion does
not make any assumption on the specific form of the
controls, except that the control outputs from a subproblem
depend on the variables of that subproblem; they may be the
variables themselves or functions of these variables (CO .j =i
Coij(Xij)). Likewise, the controls imposed on subproblem ij
(CI ij) are not specified , except that they are assumed
known once all the control outputs from higher level
subproblems (Co ri, a<i) are known. The response outputs
from a subproblem (RO ij) will be defined in this chapter.
Furthermore, it will be shown that the response inputs into
a subproblem (RI ij) are entirely known once the response
outputs from the lower level subproblems (RO as, a>i) are
known.
For each iteration of the overall system, each subproblem
is concerned with finding a design which satisfies its own
constraints for the controls specified by the higher level
subproblems (CI ij). In addition, the subproblem manipulates
its own controls (CO..) so as to improve the responses from
the lower level subproblems (RI ij ).	Mathematically, this
implies finding a design vector that satisfies a set of0"KY A p P cn- n
32	OF POOR QUALITY
equality constraints and a set of inequality constraints.
This problem may be solved by transforming it into a
nonlinear mathematical programming problem where a measure
of constraint violation is minimized with respect to the
design vector. The subproblem's own response (RO ij) is then
constituted of the minimum measure of constraint violation
as well as derivatives indicating the sensitivity of that
minimum measure to changes in the controls imposed on the
subproblem.
The subproblem on the highest level of the hierarchy
drives the whole design process. It selects its own design
variables so as to optimize the overall problem performance
index and satisfy its own constraints. It adjusts its
controls (CO 11) to improve the responses from the lower
levels (RI 11), that is, reduce the constraint violation in
the lower level subproblems.
3.2 	 LOWEST LEVEL SUBPROBLEM
Figure 2 a) describes symbolically subproblem lj, a
subproblem on the lowest level of the hierarchy. The vector
of design variables is X lj, the subproblem design is
influenced by the controls collected in vector CI lj and the
subproblem response is vector RO lj.	The subproblem

The functions g lj and elj are vector-valued. The subproblem
design is subject to a set of inequality constraints (Eq.
3.1.a). These are the constraints set on the corresponding
subsystem in the statement of the overall non-decomposed
problem. The design is also subject to a set of equality
constraints (Eq. 3.1.b). Some of these may come from the
formulation of the overall non-decomposed problem; some are
imposed on the subproblem during decomposition. The
multilevel decomposition consists of different models of the
system being designed, the models becoming more refined as
one progresses down the hierarchy. The equality constraints
arise from the necessity of requiring consistency between
the models at different levels. Also, some upper and lower
bounds may be set on the variables (Eq. 3.1.c). As stated
in the previous section, the subproblem is assumed to be
controlled by each subproblem on the higher levels. As a
result, the vector of controls CI lj is functionally
dependent on the optimum designs of all the subproblems

replaced by two inequality constraints (Eq. 3.3.c). The
distance between these constraints (2n ij ) is forced to
remain positive because of Eq. 3.3.e and to decrease because
of the second term in the objective function. 	Each
inequality constraint is relaxed by the addition of variable
E: mechanism of that relaxation is described in Fig.
3, for a simple two-dimensional problem with one equality
and three inequality constraints, assuming that the equality
constraint is identically satisfied. The first term in the
objective function (Eq. 3.3.a) is defined so as to increase
Eli . A high positive value for Eli is quite acceptable as
it means that the selected design point is deep inside the
feasible domain, away from the constraint boundaries, and
that decreases the chances of obtaining infeasible designs
when the controls are perturbed. If the solution of Problem
3.3 is so that Eli z 0 and Ti lj = 0, then it solves Problem
3.1. If, on the other hand, we have Elj < 0 or Ti lj x 0,
then the resulting design is infeasible with respect to
Problem 3.1.
Constant b is added to the definition of the objective

the different constraints. A high value for b results in a
heavy penalty paid for violating equality constraints;
conversely, a low value for b makes the penalty for
violating inequality constraints more important, in relative
terms. In addition to adjusting b, it may prove appropriate
to scale variables E1j and n1j in order to make all
components of the constraint gradients of the same order of
magnitude.
Any nonlinear programming algorithm may be used to solve
Problem 3.3. 	This yields X lj, as well as a measure of
inequality constraint violation E1j and a measure of
equality constraint violation n1j. These are functionally
dependent on the controls CI 1j and, therefore, as indicated
by Eq. 3.2, on the optimum design variables of subproblems
on higher levels. Optimum sensitivity analysis may be used
to study the effect changes in higher level subproblem
variables have on the constraint violations for subproblem

DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTILEVEL OPTIMIZATION APPROACH TO THE DESIGN
OF MODERN ENGINEERING SYSTEMS
by
Jean-Francois Marie Barthelemy
(ABSTRACT)
This work describes an optimization approach to the design
of complex engineering systems. The approach assumes a
decomposition of the original problem (design of the system)
into smaller subproblems (design of subsystems) organized in
a multilevel hierarchy. As one goes down the levels, the
details of the system become more precisely defined;
furthermore, each subproblem may control the design of lower
level subproblems.
A general algorithm is proposed which carries out the
design process iteratively, starting at the top of the
hierarchy and proceeding downward. Each subproblem is
optimized separately for fixed controls from higher level
subproblems. 	An optimum sensitivity analysis is then
performed which determines the sensitivity of the subproblem
i0R1 GINAL PACE 13
OF POOR QUALITY
design to changes in higher level subproblem controls. The
resulting sensitivity derivatives are used to construct
constraints which force the controlling subproblems into
chosing their own designs so as to improve the lower level
subproblem designs while satisfying their own constraints.
The applicability of the proposed algorithm is
demonstrated by devising a four-level hierarchy to perform
the simultaneous aerodynamic and structural design_ of a
high-performance sailplane wing for maximum cross-country
speed.	The levels are devoted successively to selecting
global	performance parameters, 	determining 	the wing
aerodynamic shape, defining the spanwise distributions of
global structural characteristics, 	and, performing the
detailed design of wing substructures.
Finally, the concepts discussed are applied to the two-
level minimum weight structural design of the sailplane
wing. The numerical experiments show that discontinuities
in the sensitivity derivatives may delay convergence, but
that the algorithm is robust enough to overcome these
discontinuities and produce low-weight feasible designs,
regardless of whether the optimization is started from the
feasible space or the infeasible one.

INTRODUCTION
The design of modern engineering systems is a procedure
which often integrates different disciplines and always
involves a large number of variables. While optimization
techniques provide an attractive formal tool for carrying
out the design process, a weakness of these techniques
remains in their inability to handle 	truly large
multidisciplinary design problems. 	To overcome that
weakness, designers must resort to some sort of
decomposition method. The original design problem is broken
down into smaller subproblems which are then optimized
separately. However, these subproblems are generally
coupled so that an iterative scheme must be devised which
coordinates their optimization in order that the resulting
design is, to some extent, optimum with respect to the
original problem.
1.1	OVERVIEW OF EXISTING LITERATURE
Several studies have been devoted to decomposition of large
optimization problems. These studies pertain to all the
areas of engineering as well as economics and management.
The following overview focuses mainly on structuralOF POOR 	 eW
optimization. For the sake of the discussion, two classes
of decomposition methods are defined: formal methods and
intuitive methods. In formal methods, the mathematical
structure of the problem is exploited to arrive at a rigid
decomposition scheme. Consequently, a rigorous framework
exists within which the mathematical properties of the
method may be assessed. In intuitive methods, understanding
of the behavior of the physical system considered is
apparently the prime factor directing the decomposition.
These methods are sometimes referred to as rational methods
and their mathematical characteristics can seldom be studied
in great detail. An intuitive approach provides, of course,
the only option for decomposing those problems which do not
possess the structure for which a formal decomposition
method exists. This division into formal and intuitive
methods is somewhat arbitrary as a given approach may very
well be shown to belong to both classes; however,it
facilitates the discussion.
1.1.1	Formal Decomposition Methods
A very extensive body of work exists on decomposition in
linear programming (LP). The existence of truly large
problems in the fields of economics and operations research
has stimulated efforts aiming at exploiting the specialOF, POOR ft:{rv^ a ^}^^
structures of the constraint matrix. The major initial step
in that area seems to have been the introduction of the
Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle in 1960. By 1970 the
developments in this active field were so numerous as to
warrant the publication of a textbook by Lasdon (Ref. 1).
In the area of structural design, problems involving
collapse design of trusses and frames were solved
successfully using the LP decomposition techniques (Refs.
2-5).
Dynamic programming (DP) was discussed by Bellman as
early as 1957 (Ref. 6). 	It is a decomposition method
suitable for nonlinear problems. The problems must be
serial, that is, of the form such that any change in the
design of one subproblem affects only those subproblems that
are	"downstream" 	in	the	decision-making 	process.
Furthermore, the problem objective function must be
additive. However, DP cannot easily handle constraints that
involve more than one subproblem. Also, it becomes very
expensive if there are large amounts of data transmitted
between successive subproblems. Among the advantages of the
DP method are its capability to generate global optimum
designs and to handle discrete variables and discontinuous
functions. In structural design, dynamic programming seems
to find use in optimization of "one-dimensional" structures,OF POOR QU ? €TV
N
that is, beams, one-bay multistory or one-story multibay
frames, and transmission towers (see Ref. 7 Chap. XI or Ref.
8).
Optimization algorithms were devised for separable
nonlinear problems using coordination techniques developed
in the context of multilevel decision-making processes.
Once a problem has been decomposed into smaller subproblems,
the main task is to coordinate the design of the different
subproblems. Essentially, the subproblems are grouped on
the lower level of a hierarchy and an additional higher
level subproblem is added whose role is to select the values
of coordinating variables so as to force the other
subproblems into choosing designs corresponding to improved
overall problem performance. The coordinating subproblem is
itself cast in the form of an optimization problem. As the
evaluation of the objective function of the coordinating
subproblem requires complete optimization of all lower level
subproblems, this type of algorithm may turn out to be very
expensive. A study of coordination in hierarchical systems
is given in the 1970 monograph by Mesarovic and coauthors
(Ref. 9). Kirsch and coworkers have used both the model
coordination technique and the goal coordination technique
to solve various structural design problems (Ref. 7 Chap. X
and Refs. 10-12)1.1.2	Intuitive Decomposition Methods
The first attempts at developing intuitive decomposition
schemes for large structural design problems were extensions
of the fully stressed design method. In these approaches
the structure is seen as a combination of elements
(substructures). 	Given an initial design for all the
elements, an analysis of the structure is made to determine
inter-element forces. 	Then, each element is optimized
separately on the assumption that changes in that element
design do not change inter-element forces. Once all the
elements have ,been designed, the structure is analyzed again
and the process repeated until convergence is achieved.
Giles (Ref. 13) and Sobieski (Ref. 14) performed the design
of airplane wings under constraints on stresses and element
stability using that approach. Kirsch and coworkers (Ref.
15) designed frameworks using a similar approach but
reanalyzing 	the	structure 	after	each	substructure
optimization, 	in order to account better for load
redistribution.
When optimizing a structure one substructure at a time,
it is difficult to handle global constraints, that is, those
constraints affected by variables belonging to more than one
substructure. In Ref. 16, Sobieski and Loendorf designed
airplane fuselages under local constraints on stresses and6
OF P'^JCR
local instabilities and global constraints on fuselage
elastic displacements. The optimization was first carried
out with the local constraints, as described above. If
necessary, the resulting design was subsequently modified to
satisfy the displacement constraints using a unit load
method to determine the impact that changes in element
design have on the violated displacements. Another example
of treatment of global constraints is given by Hughes and
coworkers (Ref. 17) who designed ship compartments for
minimum cost under constraints on stresses.
A generalized fully stressed design approach to large
problems is certainly economically appealing. However, it
presents two difficulties. As pointed out in Ref. 14
"...minimization of the individual component masses does not
guarantee minimization of the total mass This situation
is caused by the inability to control the load path on the
assembled structure level... ." As mentioned earlier also,
it makes it difficult to handle global constraints. 	In
Refs. 18 and 19 Schmit and coworkers used a two-level
approach to design trusses and aircraft wings. At the
global level, the distributions of stiffnesses, the global
level variables, were chosen so as to minimize the total
structural weight, while satisfying global displacement
constraints and also some local constraints on stresses andORIGINA L PAGE @S 	7
OF POOR QUALITY
structural element buckling. For known stiffnesses, the end
forces on the various structural elements were calculated.
At the local level, these structural elements were optimized
separately with respect to their detail design, the local
level variables, so that the changes in element stiffnesses
were minimized, while the local constraints were still
satisfied. The process was repeated until convergence was
achieved. In this decomposition, the introduction of the
global level problem was a key factor in overcoming both
difficulties . attributed to the generalized fully stressed
design approach. By placing the minimization of the weight
at the global level, the opportunity was kept to trade
structural mass between the elements in order to improve the
load paths while reducing the total weight. 	Also, the
provision was left to explicitly handle global constraints.
1.1.3	General Approach to Engineering System Design
The intuitive decomposition methods discussed to this point
are very specific and cannot easily be extended to different
classes of problems. In particular, they are not suited for
multidisciplinary problems. In Ref. 20, Sobieski proposed a
general approach to the design of large engineering systems,
and in Ref. 21, he proceeded to demonstrate the proposed
concepts by applying them to the two-level minimum weight8	 ORIGINAL RAGE IS
OF POOR QUALITY
design of a portal framework under local constraints on
stresses and local buckling and global constraints on
displacement. At the global level, the weight of the
framework is minimized with respect to the cross-sectional
area and bending moment of inertia of the different beams,
while satisfying constraints on displacements. Once a
global design is obtained, the framework is analyzed to
obtain the end loads on the beams. At the local level, each
beam is designed separately. Its detailed dimensions are
proportioned so as achieve the values of cross-sectional
area and bending moment of inertia chosen at the global
level while satisfying constraints on stresses and local
buckling. 	This is done by minimizing a measure of the
violation of the subproblem constraints. An optimum
sensitivity analysis (Ref. 22) is then performed in order to
obtain a linear approximation to the constraint violation of
each local level subproblem in terms of the global level
variables. The whole optimization is repeated, but, at the
global level, it is required that the (linearized) local
level constraint violations be reduced. This iterative
process is pursued until all the local and global level
constraints are satisfied and the framework weight cannot be
reduced further. Although the proposed scheme is applied to
a structural synthesis problem, it is applicable to any typeOt;i 	 L	r,	
9
OF POOP QUALITY
of engineering design. Furthermore, it may be used with
decompositions involving more than two levels. Some of the
key features of the approach are discussed below.
The method postulates a multilevel decomposition of the
problem, that is, a decomposition where the different
subproblems are grouped on the levels of a hierarchy. The
subproblem at the top level is concerned with the
optimization of the overall system objective in terms of
design variables describing that system in very global
terms. As one proceeds down the hierarchy, the subproblems
are dealing wi~h subsystems described in deeper and deeper
levels of detail. The choice of the specifics of the
decomposition for a given application still remains largely
a matter of physical insight and convenience.
Below the highest level, each subproblem is concerned
with finding a set of design variables which satisfy its own
constraints for fixed values of higher level variables. It
turns out that this amounts to finding a design vector which
satisfies a set of equality constraints and a set of
inequality constraints. Such a mathematical problem may not
have a solution. It may be transformed into a mathematical
programming problem which maximizes a measure of "how well"
the design satisfies the sets of constraints. The
subproblem formulation of Ref. 21 uses the equality10
ORIGINAL PAGE 19
OF POOR QUALITY
constraints to eliminate dependent variables and forms a
penalty function with the inequality constraints. That
penalty function is a measure of constraint violation which
is then minimized with respect to the independent variables
to find that design which best meets the constraints.
Once designs are obtained for all the subproblems on a
given level, sensitivity analyses are performed to determine
the effect changes in higher level variables have on lower
level constraint violations. The resulting sensitivity
derivatives are used to construct linear approximations to
the lower subproblem constraint violations in terms of the
higher level design variables. 	These approximations are
added as constraints for the next optimization of the higher
level subproblems. This enables the optimization of the
higher level subproblems to be conducted so as to improve
the design of the lower level subproblems which have
violated constraints or so as to reduce the margin of
satisfaction for those subproblems for which all constraints
are amply satisfied. In essence, this makes the trade-offs
between the different subproblems visible and allows them to
be resolved in a rational fashion.
The task of the highest level subproblem remains the
optimization of the system performance index with respect to
its own global variables which are required not only toI= POOR QUALITY
satisfy its own constraints but also to reduce the
constraint violation for the lower level subproblems.
1.2	OUTLINE
The purpose of this work has been to investigate the
applicability of Sobieski's method to the design of complex,
multidisciplinary engineering systems. It was elected to
focus the effort on a specific example: the simultaneous
aerodynamic and structural design of a high-performance
sailplane wing for maximum cross-country speed. 	It was
determined that this design problem could be carried out by
means of a four-level decomposition. An algorithm was
developed to solve the problem and it was tested on the two
lower levels of the decomposition.
In Chapter II, we discuss the optimum sensitivity
analysis technique. We show that the stationary conditions
satisfied at a local constrained optimum may be used to
determine the sensitivity of optimum objective functions and
design variables to changes in those parameters that were
kept fixed during the optimization.
Chapter III is devoted to a detailed description of the
proposed algorithm. It is constructed along the same lines
as that described in Ref. 20. The main difference resides
with the specifics of the mathematical formulation for the12
OF pOOR QUALITY
individual subproblems. The present algorithm treats
equality constraints in a general numerical fashion.
Furthermore, it is designed as a constrained programming
problem rather than as a penalty function minimization
problem. Particular attention is paid to the potential
difficulties associated with decompositions that involve
more than two levels.
In Chapter IV, the decomposition proposed for the example
problem is detailed. It is a four-level decomposition. The
highest level subproblem entails selection of global
performance parameters which include weight and aerodynamic
characteristics. Then follows an aerodynamic subproblem
where the shape of the wing is defined so as to obtain the
aerodynamic characteristics specified in the performance
subproblem and control the initiation bf stall. On the
third level of the decomposition is a global structural
subproblem where the wing -spanwise distributions of weight
and stiffnesses are selected for fixed total weight and so
as to limit the wing bending response and torsional
divergence speed. Finally, at the lowest level, the wing is
modeled by a series of spanwise elements each of which is
designed separately for fixed weight and stiffnesses under
stress and local buckling constraints.
sl13
In Chapter V, the algorithm introduced in Chap. III is
applied to the two lower levels of the hierarchy described
in Chap. IV. The problem solved is the minimum weight
design of a straight composite wing. Results are given for
designs started from both the feasible space and the
infeasible space.
Finally, Chapter VI is devoted to synthesizing the
experience gained with this work and making recommendations
for continued investigation.OF POOR QJHLi d V

one to investigate the sensitivity of the solution of an
optimization problem to variations in the parameters of the
problem. It yields derivatives of the optimum values of the
design variables and objective function with respect to the
parameters, derivatives which may then be used to perform
trade-off analyses. These derivatives are called
sensitivity derivatives to distinguish them from the
derivatives of objective function and constraints with
respect to the design variables which are termed behavior
derivatives. 	This technique was recently introduced by
Sobieski and coauthors (Ref. 22) as a tool for structural
synthesis. It has been specialized by Schmit and Chang
(Ref. 23) to a formulation of the problem of structural
sizing for mimimum weight based on approximation concepts
and dual methods, and has been used by Haftka (Ref.  24 ) in
the optimization of damage tolerant structures. The
elements of the technique required for the remainder of this
work are discussed in this chapter; the reader interested in
a more general discussion should consult Ref. 22.

mathematical programming problem

where vector X contains the n design variables of the
problem, while vector P contains k parameters that are kept
fixed during the optimization process. The constraint g is
vector-valued, in general; it is assumed here to have m
components. The optimum solution is functionally dependent
*on the parameters, hence, using ( ) to denote optimum
quantities

In	these	equations, 	subscript 	x	indicates 	partial
derivatives with respect to the design variables;
superscript a refers to the constraints exactly satisfied
(active) at the local minimum (there are m a such constraints
and g  is a subvector of g); finally, X is the vector of
Lagrange multipliers (dual variables). The object of
optimum sensitivity analysis is to find the rates of change
of F and X with respect to P. We define these rates of
changes as follows
X' = dX	(matrix, nxk components)
dP+
F' = dF	(vector, k components) 	 (2.4)

If F'	and X'	are known, 	we may construct linear
approximations to the solution of Problem (2.1),
F*(P+AP) = F*(P)+F'TAP
X*(P+AP) = X *(P)+X'TAP	(2.5)
The two following sections are devoted to calculating F' and
X'.
2.2	SENSITIVITY DERIVATIVES OF THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
The optimum sensitivity derivative of the objective function
is obtained by the chain rule of differentiation as
F' = FP+X' TFx	(2.6)OF POOR QUALITY
where subscript p indicates partial derivatives with respect
to vector P. Now, we can show that F' may be found without
actually calculating X'. We require that the optimum point
for P+AP remain at the intersection of the constraints
determining the optimum point for P. Hence, the second of
Eqs. 2.3 is stationary with respect to P,
,_(,a*) = gp*+ga*X' = 0	(2.7)
*Combining Eq. 2.7 transposed and postmultiplied by a and
the first of Eqs. 2.3 premultiplied by X' T, we obtain
X'TFx = 9a*T a*	 (2.8)
or
F' = Fp+,a*T a *	(2.9)
*The Lagrange multipliers a may be available as by-products
of the optimization scheme; otherwise, they may be obtained
by QR decomposition or from the more classical least-squares
solution to the first of Eqs. 2.3,

Then, Eq. 2.9 yields F' directly. 	An alternate solution
exists because Eq. 2.7 is the only condition that X' must18	AV PP.Gr ts

X'TF = ga*Ta* = YTF x	p	x
and
F' = Fp+YTFx	(2.12)
Equation 2.11 represents k sets of m a linear equations in n
unknowns, with m a <_ n. We may therefore give arbitrary
values to n-m a components of each column of Y and deduce the
remaining m a components from Eq. 2.11. In general, Y
differs from the true sensitivity derivatives of the
variables X' , unless n = m a. Assume that, in the space of
the design variables X, an infinitesimal perturbation of
parameter P results in a move from the initial point in the
direction specified by Y. Then, the resulting design is
still at the intersection of the originally active
constraints because condition 2.7 is enforced; however, it
may not be optimum because the first of Eqs. 2.3 may not be
satisfied any more.

The approach of Sec. 2.2 yields the exact value of F' at
considerably lower cost than that of Sec. 2.3 since it
involves only first-order partial derivatives of F and q 
with respect to the design variables and parameters of the
problem. However, it does not usually permit one to obtain
X' (unless n = m a). The choice between the two types of
analysis is very much dependent on the application
considered and the nature of the optimization problem at
hand. It must be guided by a comparison between the cost of
calculating second-order partial derivatives of F and g  on
the one hand, and the benefit of knowing the sensitivity
derivatives of the variables on the other hand.
It must be noted that higher order sensitivity
derivatives may be obtained for X F and X by setting
higher order total derivatives of the two first stationary
conditions (Eqs. 2.3) to zero. In particular, Ref. 25 shows
how little additional calculation is required to find F",
once X' has been obtained.
2.4	ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
After solving a mathematical programming problem and
before performing sensitivity analysis, it is necessary to
find the set of the active constraints. These constraints
must satisfy Eqs. 2.3; furthermore, their gradients must be21QF:i zrr',AL! el-- y N:^

linearly independent, if one wants to obtain the Lagrange
multipliers from Eq. 2.10. The algorithm described below
was used with success.
i)Select an initial set S  of nearly satisfied
constraints by retaining those constraints whose
value is above a small negative tolerance.
ii)Identify S pa, the subset of S a which contains the
maximum number of constraints with independent
gradients. To achieve that, the constraint
gradients are taken as the columns of a rectangular
matrix and a Gaussian elimination with row and
column interchanges is performed to identify the
independent columns.
iii)Use Eq. 2.10 to find the Lagrange multipliers
corresponding to set S pa. Note that the fact that
the constraints of set Spa have independent
gradients is a guarantee that Eq. 2.10 has a
solution.
iv)Find the smallest Lagrange multiplier ai.
V)	If X. is negative (less than a small positive
tolerance), eliminate constraint i from set S  and
restart the process in ii). 	If X  is positive,
terminate the process since S'a is the desired set.22	'3F ? DR U` F_:
Note that steps ii) and iii) would not be required if QR
decomposition were used. In step v), only the constraints
with strictly positive Lagrange multipliers are kept, even
though active constraints may have Lagrange multipliers that
are zero. This is because constraints with zero Lagrange
multipliers are redundant; hence, their gradients are
linearly dependent on other constraint gradients.
In this work, the sensitivity derivatives are used to
extend optimization information over a range of variation
for the parameters of the design problems considered. This
is achieved by means of the linear extrapolations given in
Eq. 2.5. The implicit relationships 2.2 are expected to be
nonlinear, in general. Hence, the extrapolations being
first-order Taylor series expansions, they are valid only
for limited AP. Furthermore, the calculation of the
sensitivity derivatives is based on the assumption that the
set of constraints active at the initial optimum will remain
unchanged as the parameter P is changed to P+AP.
Perturbations of the parameters cause moves of the
constraint boundaries with respect to each other and,
therefore, may very well result in changes in the active
constraint set. These changes then imply reduced accuracy
of the extrapolated optima. The question arises of whether
it is possible to estimate the magnitude of the parameterOF POOR QvA° ITY
perturbations which cause changes in the active constraint
set. It was proposed in Ref. 22 that the perturbation of
parameter p (element of vector P) which results in
constraint i changing from active status to inactive status
may be obtained to the first order by stating that X  is
reduced to zero when constraint i leaves the active set,
Xi(P+APi) _ Xi(P)+Xi(P)APi = 0
or
Opi = -ai(P)/Xi(P)	(2.15)
Reference 22 likewise suggested that the perturbation of
parameter p causing constraint i to change from inactive
status to active status could be found as that value ep i for
which gi(p+Api) becomes zero.
gi(P+APi) = gi(P)+1gix(P)X'(P)1APi = 0
then
APi= -gi(P)/Igix( P)X'(P))	(2.16)
It was observed in Ref. 26 that Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 could be
unreliable. These estimates were used to determine with a
specific design problem example what parameter perturbations
cause changes in the status of the different constraints247^ "n
OF POOR QJAUTY
involved, attempting so to speak, to construct an history
of the active constraint set as p varies. This may not be
an appropriate approach. Indeed, Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 may be
used to estimate a Ap i for each of the problem constraints,
indicating when the status of a particular constraint is
supposed to change. However, only the smallest (in absolute
value) negative and positive of these dp i (Ap_ and 4p+)
should be taken into consideration. The extrapolations
based on sensitivity derivatives obtained at p should be
adequate for p+Ap - < p+pp 5 p+pp +, But any prediction
beyond that range (in particular prediction of change in the
active constraint set) should not be relied upon since it
would have been obtained with derivatives corresponding to
an inappropriate active constraint set. In essence, as
suggested in Ref. 23, the Ap i of Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 must be
regarded as bounds on Op. Barring excessive nonlinearity,
the range of ep defined by the intersection of these bounds
is that within which the extrapolations based on sensitivity
derivatives calculated at p should be reliable. 	In the
absence of changes in the active constraint set, the
accuracy of Eq. 	2.5 is limited only by the inherent
nonlinearity of the specific design problem considered.
Experiments conducted with various structural design
problems showed (Ref. 22) that linear-extrapolation-based25
N
estimates of optimum objective functions and design
variables fell within a few percent of actual optimization
result, for parameter variations of up to twenty percent;
the predictions often were better for the objective function
than for the design variables.(n^ niece,.

PRESENTATION OF THE ALGORITHM
This chapter is devoted to discussing an algorithm proposed
for the design of complex engineering systems. The method
is based on multilevel decomposition of the corresponding
design problems 	into	subproblems 	which	are	solved
separately. 	The algorithm is discussed in general terms.
This is done so as to avoid focusing on a particular
problem. 	The following chapter will be devoted to
investigating the applicability of the approach described
here to a specific problem. 	The abstract concepts
introduced here can be more easily put in a physical context
if this chapter and the following one are read
simultaneously. The presentation begins with a definition
of the type of multilevel decomposition considered and of
the components of that decomposition. Then, the discussion
centers on the formulation and solution of the subproblems.
Finally, the organization of the overall optimization is
discussed. 	The developments follow those by Sobieski in
Ref. 20.

3.1	DEFINITIONS
The starting point of this discussion is the task of
designing a system by finding a set of variables which
optimize a performance index while satisfying a number of
constraints. This will be referred to as the
overall problem. Assume that, for convenience, the overall
problem is decomposed into a number of subproblems, each of
which corresponds to the design of a subsystem, and has its
own sets of variables and constraints. The subproblems are
organized in a hierarchy as shown on Fig. 1. The subproblem
at the top of the hierarchy is the design of the whole
system, in very general terms. The next level deals with
major subsystems, the third one with subsystems of the major
subsystems, and so on. As one goes down the levels, the
details of the system become more and more precisely
defined. The subproblems are identified by two numbers ij
which define (i) the level of the subproblem, and (j) its
position on that level. 	The level numbers increase
downward, and the subproblem numbers increase, say, from
left to right. The hierarchy is assumed to have 1 levels,
there are n  subproblems on level i.
The whole design process is conducted iteratively,
starting at the highest level and going down. 	Each
subsystem is designed separately. 	The object of the
algorithm is to coordinate the design of the different28

subsystems so as to obtain optimum system performance by
resolving the trade-offs between the subsystems in a
rational fashion. This is achieved by manipulating two
types of interactions between the subproblems: the controls
and the responses. A control is a quantity selected in a
subproblem to influence another subproblem in the hierarchy.
A response is a quantity that reflects the effect the design
of one subproblem has on that of another subproblem. In
this work, we assume that the controls flow exclusively
downward in the hierarchy, while the responses flow
exclusively upward. This excludes situations where a
subproblem controls another subproblem on the same level
(lateral control) or on a higher level (reverse control).'
As represented symbolically on Fig. 2, each subproblem is
assumed to receive controls from higher level subproblems
through vector CI ij (control inputs in subproblem if), and
to receive responses from lower level subproblems through
vector RIij (response inputs in subproblem i1). Also, each
subproblem is assumed to control lower level subproblems
with vector COij (control outputs from subproblem i^), and
' In Ref. 20, the controls are named interaction quantities.
The interested reader should refer to that source for
indications as to how to handle reverse and lateral
controls.c) Highest level subproblem.

to respond to higher level subproblems with vector ROij
(response outputs from subproblem ice). This discussion does
not make any assumption on the specific form of the
controls, except that the control outputs from a subproblem
depend on the variables of that subproblem; they may be the
variables themselves or functions of these variables (CO .j =i
Coij(Xij)). Likewise, the controls imposed on subproblem ij
(CI ij) are not specified , except that they are assumed
known once all the control outputs from higher level
subproblems (Co ri, a<i) are known. The response outputs
from a subproblem (RO ij) will be defined in this chapter.
Furthermore, it will be shown that the response inputs into
a subproblem (RI ij) are entirely known once the response
outputs from the lower level subproblems (RO as, a>i) are
known.
For each iteration of the overall system, each subproblem
is concerned with finding a design which satisfies its own
constraints for the controls specified by the higher level
subproblems (CI ij). In addition, the subproblem manipulates
its own controls (CO..) so as to improve the responses from
the lower level subproblems (RI ij ).	Mathematically, this
implies finding a design vector that satisfies a set of0"KY A p P cn- n
32	OF POOR QUALITY
equality constraints and a set of inequality constraints.
This problem may be solved by transforming it into a
nonlinear mathematical programming problem where a measure
of constraint violation is minimized with respect to the
design vector. The subproblem's own response (RO ij) is then
constituted of the minimum measure of constraint violation
as well as derivatives indicating the sensitivity of that
minimum measure to changes in the controls imposed on the
subproblem.
The subproblem on the highest level of the hierarchy
drives the whole design process. It selects its own design
variables so as to optimize the overall problem performance
index and satisfy its own constraints. It adjusts its
controls (CO 11) to improve the responses from the lower
levels (RI 11), that is, reduce the constraint violation in
the lower level subproblems.
3.2 	 LOWEST LEVEL SUBPROBLEM
Figure 2 a) describes symbolically subproblem lj, a
subproblem on the lowest level of the hierarchy. The vector
of design variables is X lj, the subproblem design is
influenced by the controls collected in vector CI lj and the
subproblem response is vector RO lj.	The subproblem

The functions g lj and elj are vector-valued. The subproblem
design is subject to a set of inequality constraints (Eq.
3.1.a). These are the constraints set on the corresponding
subsystem in the statement of the overall non-decomposed
problem. The design is also subject to a set of equality
constraints (Eq. 3.1.b). Some of these may come from the
formulation of the overall non-decomposed problem; some are
imposed on the subproblem during decomposition. The
multilevel decomposition consists of different models of the
system being designed, the models becoming more refined as
one progresses down the hierarchy. The equality constraints
arise from the necessity of requiring consistency between
the models at different levels. Also, some upper and lower
bounds may be set on the variables (Eq. 3.1.c). As stated
in the previous section, the subproblem is assumed to be
controlled by each subproblem on the higher levels. As a
result, the vector of controls CI lj is functionally
dependent on the optimum designs of all the subproblems

replaced by two inequality constraints (Eq. 3.3.c). The
distance between these constraints (2n ij ) is forced to
remain positive because of Eq. 3.3.e and to decrease because
of the second term in the objective function. 	Each
inequality constraint is relaxed by the addition of variable
E: mechanism of that relaxation is described in Fig.
3, for a simple two-dimensional problem with one equality
and three inequality constraints, assuming that the equality
constraint is identically satisfied. The first term in the
objective function (Eq. 3.3.a) is defined so as to increase
Eli . A high positive value for Eli is quite acceptable as
it means that the selected design point is deep inside the
feasible domain, away from the constraint boundaries, and
that decreases the chances of obtaining infeasible designs
when the controls are perturbed. If the solution of Problem
3.3 is so that Eli z 0 and Ti lj = 0, then it solves Problem
3.1. If, on the other hand, we have Elj < 0 or Ti lj x 0,
then the resulting design is infeasible with respect to
Problem 3.1.
Constant b is added to the definition of the objective
function to control the importance attributed to violatingOF POOP: QJA i"d Y
the different constraints. A high value for b results in a
heavy penalty paid for violating equality constraints;
conversely, a low value for b makes the penalty for
violating inequality constraints more important, in relative
terms. In addition to adjusting b, it may prove appropriate
to scale variables E1j and n1j in order to make all
components of the constraint gradients of the same order of
magnitude.
Any nonlinear programming algorithm may be used to solve
Problem 3.3. 	This yields X lj, as well as a measure of
inequality constraint violation E1j and a measure of
equality constraint violation n1j. These are functionally
dependent on the controls CI 1j and, therefore, as indicated
by Eq. 3.2, on the optimum design variables of subproblems
on higher levels. Optimum sensitivity analysis may be used
to study the effect changes in higher level subproblem
variables have on the constraint violations for subproblem
lj.	Considering £1j, if all higher level subproblem

DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTILEVEL OPTIMIZATION APPROACH TO THE DESIGN
OF MODERN ENGINEERING SYSTEMS
by
Jean-Francois Marie Barthelemy
(ABSTRACT)
This work describes an optimization approach to the design
of complex engineering systems. The approach assumes a
decomposition of the original problem (design of the system)
into smaller subproblems (design of subsystems) organized in
a multilevel hierarchy. As one goes down the levels, the
details of the system become more precisely defined;
furthermore, each subproblem may control the design of lower
level subproblems.
A general algorithm is proposed which carries out the
design process iteratively, starting at the top of the
hierarchy and proceeding downward. Each subproblem is
optimized separately for fixed controls from higher level
subproblems. 	An optimum sensitivity analysis is then
performed which determines the sensitivity of the subproblem
i0R1 GINAL PACE 13
OF POOR QUALITY
design to changes in higher level subproblem controls. The
resulting sensitivity derivatives are used to construct
constraints which force the controlling subproblems into
chosing their own designs so as to improve the lower level
subproblem designs while satisfying their own constraints.
The applicability of the proposed algorithm is
demonstrated by devising a four-level hierarchy to perform
the simultaneous aerodynamic and structural design_ of a
high-performance sailplane wing for maximum cross-country
speed.	The levels are devoted successively to selecting
global	performance parameters, 	determining 	the wing
aerodynamic shape, defining the spanwise distributions of
global structural characteristics, 	and, performing the
detailed design of wing substructures.
Finally, the concepts discussed are applied to the two-
level minimum weight structural design of the sailplane
wing. The numerical experiments show that discontinuities
in the sensitivity derivatives may delay convergence, but
that the algorithm is robust enough to overcome these
discontinuities and produce low-weight feasible designs,
regardless of whether the optimization is started from the
feasible space or the infeasible one.

INTRODUCTION
The design of modern engineering systems is a procedure
which often integrates different disciplines and always
involves a large number of variables. While optimization
techniques provide an attractive formal tool for carrying
out the design process, a weakness of these techniques
remains in their inability to handle 	truly large
multidisciplinary design problems. 	To overcome that
weakness, designers must resort to some sort of
decomposition method. The original design problem is broken
down into smaller subproblems which are then optimized
separately. However, these subproblems are generally
coupled so that an iterative scheme must be devised which
coordinates their optimization in order that the resulting
design is, to some extent, optimum with respect to the
original problem.
1.1	OVERVIEW OF EXISTING LITERATURE
Several studies have been devoted to decomposition of large
optimization problems. These studies pertain to all the
areas of engineering as well as economics and management.
The following overview focuses mainly on structuralOF POOR 	 eW
optimization. For the sake of the discussion, two classes
of decomposition methods are defined: formal methods and
intuitive methods. In formal methods, the mathematical
structure of the problem is exploited to arrive at a rigid
decomposition scheme. Consequently, a rigorous framework
exists within which the mathematical properties of the
method may be assessed. In intuitive methods, understanding
of the behavior of the physical system considered is
apparently the prime factor directing the decomposition.
These methods are sometimes referred to as rational methods
and their mathematical characteristics can seldom be studied
in great detail. An intuitive approach provides, of course,
the only option for decomposing those problems which do not
possess the structure for which a formal decomposition
method exists. This division into formal and intuitive
methods is somewhat arbitrary as a given approach may very
well be shown to belong to both classes; however,it
facilitates the discussion.
1.1.1	Formal Decomposition Methods
A very extensive body of work exists on decomposition in
linear programming (LP). The existence of truly large
problems in the fields of economics and operations research
has stimulated efforts aiming at exploiting the specialOF, POOR ft:{rv^ a ^}^^
structures of the constraint matrix. The major initial step
in that area seems to have been the introduction of the
Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle in 1960. By 1970 the
developments in this active field were so numerous as to
warrant the publication of a textbook by Lasdon (Ref. 1).
In the area of structural design, problems involving
collapse design of trusses and frames were solved
successfully using the LP decomposition techniques (Refs.
2-5).
Dynamic programming (DP) was discussed by Bellman as
early as 1957 (Ref. 6). 	It is a decomposition method
suitable for nonlinear problems. The problems must be
serial, that is, of the form such that any change in the
design of one subproblem affects only those subproblems that
are	"downstream" 	in	the	decision-making 	process.
Furthermore, the problem objective function must be
additive. However, DP cannot easily handle constraints that
involve more than one subproblem. Also, it becomes very
expensive if there are large amounts of data transmitted
between successive subproblems. Among the advantages of the
DP method are its capability to generate global optimum
designs and to handle discrete variables and discontinuous
functions. In structural design, dynamic programming seems
to find use in optimization of "one-dimensional" structures,OF POOR QU ? €TV
N
that is, beams, one-bay multistory or one-story multibay
frames, and transmission towers (see Ref. 7 Chap. XI or Ref.
8).
Optimization algorithms were devised for separable
nonlinear problems using coordination techniques developed
in the context of multilevel decision-making processes.
Once a problem has been decomposed into smaller subproblems,
the main task is to coordinate the design of the different
subproblems. Essentially, the subproblems are grouped on
the lower level of a hierarchy and an additional higher
level subproblem is added whose role is to select the values
of coordinating variables so as to force the other
subproblems into choosing designs corresponding to improved
overall problem performance. The coordinating subproblem is
itself cast in the form of an optimization problem. As the
evaluation of the objective function of the coordinating
subproblem requires complete optimization of all lower level
subproblems, this type of algorithm may turn out to be very
expensive. A study of coordination in hierarchical systems
is given in the 1970 monograph by Mesarovic and coauthors
(Ref. 9). Kirsch and coworkers have used both the model
coordination technique and the goal coordination technique
to solve various structural design problems (Ref. 7 Chap. X
and Refs. 10-12)1.1.2	Intuitive Decomposition Methods
The first attempts at developing intuitive decomposition
schemes for large structural design problems were extensions
of the fully stressed design method. In these approaches
the structure is seen as a combination of elements
(substructures). 	Given an initial design for all the
elements, an analysis of the structure is made to determine
inter-element forces. 	Then, each element is optimized
separately on the assumption that changes in that element
design do not change inter-element forces. Once all the
elements have ,been designed, the structure is analyzed again
and the process repeated until convergence is achieved.
Giles (Ref. 13) and Sobieski (Ref. 14) performed the design
of airplane wings under constraints on stresses and element
stability using that approach. Kirsch and coworkers (Ref.
15) designed frameworks using a similar approach but
reanalyzing 	the	structure 	after	each	substructure
optimization, 	in order to account better for load
redistribution.
When optimizing a structure one substructure at a time,
it is difficult to handle global constraints, that is, those
constraints affected by variables belonging to more than one
substructure. In Ref. 16, Sobieski and Loendorf designed
airplane fuselages under local constraints on stresses and6
OF P'^JCR
local instabilities and global constraints on fuselage
elastic displacements. The optimization was first carried
out with the local constraints, as described above. If
necessary, the resulting design was subsequently modified to
satisfy the displacement constraints using a unit load
method to determine the impact that changes in element
design have on the violated displacements. Another example
of treatment of global constraints is given by Hughes and
coworkers (Ref. 17) who designed ship compartments for
minimum cost under constraints on stresses.
A generalized fully stressed design approach to large
problems is certainly economically appealing. However, it
presents two difficulties. As pointed out in Ref. 14
"...minimization of the individual component masses does not
guarantee minimization of the total mass This situation
is caused by the inability to control the load path on the
assembled structure level... ." As mentioned earlier also,
it makes it difficult to handle global constraints. 	In
Refs. 18 and 19 Schmit and coworkers used a two-level
approach to design trusses and aircraft wings. At the
global level, the distributions of stiffnesses, the global
level variables, were chosen so as to minimize the total
structural weight, while satisfying global displacement
constraints and also some local constraints on stresses andORIGINA L PAGE @S 	7
OF POOR QUALITY
structural element buckling. For known stiffnesses, the end
forces on the various structural elements were calculated.
At the local level, these structural elements were optimized
separately with respect to their detail design, the local
level variables, so that the changes in element stiffnesses
were minimized, while the local constraints were still
satisfied. The process was repeated until convergence was
achieved. In this decomposition, the introduction of the
global level problem was a key factor in overcoming both
difficulties . attributed to the generalized fully stressed
design approach. By placing the minimization of the weight
at the global level, the opportunity was kept to trade
structural mass between the elements in order to improve the
load paths while reducing the total weight. 	Also, the
provision was left to explicitly handle global constraints.
1.1.3	General Approach to Engineering System Design
The intuitive decomposition methods discussed to this point
are very specific and cannot easily be extended to different
classes of problems. In particular, they are not suited for
multidisciplinary problems. In Ref. 20, Sobieski proposed a
general approach to the design of large engineering systems,
and in Ref. 21, he proceeded to demonstrate the proposed
concepts by applying them to the two-level minimum weight8	 ORIGINAL RAGE IS
OF POOR QUALITY
design of a portal framework under local constraints on
stresses and local buckling and global constraints on
displacement. At the global level, the weight of the
framework is minimized with respect to the cross-sectional
area and bending moment of inertia of the different beams,
while satisfying constraints on displacements. Once a
global design is obtained, the framework is analyzed to
obtain the end loads on the beams. At the local level, each
beam is designed separately. Its detailed dimensions are
proportioned so as achieve the values of cross-sectional
area and bending moment of inertia chosen at the global
level while satisfying constraints on stresses and local
buckling. 	This is done by minimizing a measure of the
violation of the subproblem constraints. An optimum
sensitivity analysis (Ref. 22) is then performed in order to
obtain a linear approximation to the constraint violation of
each local level subproblem in terms of the global level
variables. The whole optimization is repeated, but, at the
global level, it is required that the (linearized) local
level constraint violations be reduced. This iterative
process is pursued until all the local and global level
constraints are satisfied and the framework weight cannot be
reduced further. Although the proposed scheme is applied to
a structural synthesis problem, it is applicable to any typeOt;i 	 L	r,	
9
OF POOP QUALITY
of engineering design. Furthermore, it may be used with
decompositions involving more than two levels. Some of the
key features of the approach are discussed below.
The method postulates a multilevel decomposition of the
problem, that is, a decomposition where the different
subproblems are grouped on the levels of a hierarchy. The
subproblem at the top level is concerned with the
optimization of the overall system objective in terms of
design variables describing that system in very global
terms. As one proceeds down the hierarchy, the subproblems
are dealing wi~h subsystems described in deeper and deeper
levels of detail. The choice of the specifics of the
decomposition for a given application still remains largely
a matter of physical insight and convenience.
Below the highest level, each subproblem is concerned
with finding a set of design variables which satisfy its own
constraints for fixed values of higher level variables. It
turns out that this amounts to finding a design vector which
satisfies a set of equality constraints and a set of
inequality constraints. Such a mathematical problem may not
have a solution. It may be transformed into a mathematical
programming problem which maximizes a measure of "how well"
the design satisfies the sets of constraints. The
subproblem formulation of Ref. 21 uses the equality10
ORIGINAL PAGE 19
OF POOR QUALITY
constraints to eliminate dependent variables and forms a
penalty function with the inequality constraints. That
penalty function is a measure of constraint violation which
is then minimized with respect to the independent variables
to find that design which best meets the constraints.
Once designs are obtained for all the subproblems on a
given level, sensitivity analyses are performed to determine
the effect changes in higher level variables have on lower
level constraint violations. The resulting sensitivity
derivatives are used to construct linear approximations to
the lower subproblem constraint violations in terms of the
higher level design variables. 	These approximations are
added as constraints for the next optimization of the higher
level subproblems. This enables the optimization of the
higher level subproblems to be conducted so as to improve
the design of the lower level subproblems which have
violated constraints or so as to reduce the margin of
satisfaction for those subproblems for which all constraints
are amply satisfied. In essence, this makes the trade-offs
between the different subproblems visible and allows them to
be resolved in a rational fashion.
The task of the highest level subproblem remains the
optimization of the system performance index with respect to
its own global variables which are required not only toI= POOR QUALITY
satisfy its own constraints but also to reduce the
constraint violation for the lower level subproblems.
1.2	OUTLINE
The purpose of this work has been to investigate the
applicability of Sobieski's method to the design of complex,
multidisciplinary engineering systems. It was elected to
focus the effort on a specific example: the simultaneous
aerodynamic and structural design of a high-performance
sailplane wing for maximum cross-country speed. 	It was
determined that this design problem could be carried out by
means of a four-level decomposition. An algorithm was
developed to solve the problem and it was tested on the two
lower levels of the decomposition.
In Chapter II, we discuss the optimum sensitivity
analysis technique. We show that the stationary conditions
satisfied at a local constrained optimum may be used to
determine the sensitivity of optimum objective functions and
design variables to changes in those parameters that were
kept fixed during the optimization.
Chapter III is devoted to a detailed description of the
proposed algorithm. It is constructed along the same lines
as that described in Ref. 20. The main difference resides
with the specifics of the mathematical formulation for the12
OF pOOR QUALITY
individual subproblems. The present algorithm treats
equality constraints in a general numerical fashion.
Furthermore, it is designed as a constrained programming
problem rather than as a penalty function minimization
problem. Particular attention is paid to the potential
difficulties associated with decompositions that involve
more than two levels.
In Chapter IV, the decomposition proposed for the example
problem is detailed. It is a four-level decomposition. The
highest level subproblem entails selection of global
performance parameters which include weight and aerodynamic
characteristics. Then follows an aerodynamic subproblem
where the shape of the wing is defined so as to obtain the
aerodynamic characteristics specified in the performance
subproblem and control the initiation bf stall. On the
third level of the decomposition is a global structural
subproblem where the wing -spanwise distributions of weight
and stiffnesses are selected for fixed total weight and so
as to limit the wing bending response and torsional
divergence speed. Finally, at the lowest level, the wing is
modeled by a series of spanwise elements each of which is
designed separately for fixed weight and stiffnesses under
stress and local buckling constraints.
sl13
In Chapter V, the algorithm introduced in Chap. III is
applied to the two lower levels of the hierarchy described
in Chap. IV. The problem solved is the minimum weight
design of a straight composite wing. Results are given for
designs started from both the feasible space and the
infeasible space.
Finally, Chapter VI is devoted to synthesizing the
experience gained with this work and making recommendations
for continued investigation.OF POOR QJHLi d V

SUMMARY OF PERTINENT RESULTS FROM OPTIMUM
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Optimum sensitivity analysis is a technique which permits
one to investigate the sensitivity of the solution of an
optimization problem to variations in the parameters of the
problem. It yields derivatives of the optimum values of the
design variables and objective function with respect to the
parameters, derivatives which may then be used to perform
trade-off analyses. These derivatives are called
sensitivity derivatives to distinguish them from the
derivatives of objective function and constraints with
respect to the design variables which are termed behavior
derivatives. 	This technique was recently introduced by
Sobieski and coauthors (Ref. 22) as a tool for structural
synthesis. It has been specialized by Schmit and Chang
(Ref. 23) to a formulation of the problem of structural
sizing for mimimum weight based on approximation concepts
and dual methods, and has been used by Haftka (Ref.  24 ) in
the optimization of damage tolerant structures. The
elements of the technique required for the remainder of this
work are discussed in this chapter; the reader interested in
a more general discussion should consult Ref. 22.

In	these	equations, 	subscript 	x	indicates 	partial
derivatives with respect to the design variables;
superscript a refers to the constraints exactly satisfied
(active) at the local minimum (there are m a such constraints
and g  is a subvector of g); finally, X is the vector of
Lagrange multipliers (dual variables). The object of
optimum sensitivity analysis is to find the rates of change
of F and X with respect to P. We define these rates of
changes as follows
X' = dX	(matrix, nxk components)

The two following sections are devoted to calculating F' and
X'.
2.2	SENSITIVITY DERIVATIVES OF THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
The optimum sensitivity derivative of the objective function
is obtained by the chain rule of differentiation as
F' = FP+X' TFx	(2.6)OF POOR QUALITY
where subscript p indicates partial derivatives with respect
to vector P. Now, we can show that F' may be found without
actually calculating X'. We require that the optimum point
for P+AP remain at the intersection of the constraints
determining the optimum point for P. Hence, the second of
Eqs. 2.3 is stationary with respect to P,
,_(,a*) = gp*+ga*X' = 0	(2.7)
*Combining Eq. 2.7 transposed and postmultiplied by a and
the first of Eqs. 2.3 premultiplied by X' T, we obtain
X'TFx = 9a*T a*	 (2.8)
or
F' = Fp+,a*T a *	(2.9)
*The Lagrange multipliers a may be available as by-products
of the optimization scheme; otherwise, they may be obtained
by QR decomposition or from the more classical least-squares
solution to the first of Eqs. 2.3,

Then, Eq. 2.9 yields F' directly. 	An alternate solution

Equation 2.11 represents k sets of m a linear equations in n
unknowns, with m a <_ n. We may therefore give arbitrary
values to n-m a components of each column of Y and deduce the
remaining m a components from Eq. 2.11. In general, Y
differs from the true sensitivity derivatives of the
variables X' , unless n = m a. Assume that, in the space of
the design variables X, an infinitesimal perturbation of
parameter P results in a move from the initial point in the
direction specified by Y. Then, the resulting design is
still at the intersection of the originally active
constraints because condition 2.7 is enforced; however, it
may not be optimum because the first of Eqs. 2.3 may not be
satisfied any more.

The approach of Sec. 2.2 yields the exact value of F' at
considerably lower cost than that of Sec. 2.3 since it
involves only first-order partial derivatives of F and q 
with respect to the design variables and parameters of the
problem. However, it does not usually permit one to obtain
X' (unless n = m a). The choice between the two types of
analysis is very much dependent on the application
considered and the nature of the optimization problem at
hand. It must be guided by a comparison between the cost of
calculating second-order partial derivatives of F and g  on
the one hand, and the benefit of knowing the sensitivity
derivatives of the variables on the other hand.
It must be noted that higher order sensitivity
derivatives may be obtained for X F and X by setting
higher order total derivatives of the two first stationary
conditions (Eqs. 2.3) to zero. In particular, Ref. 25 shows
how little additional calculation is required to find F",
once X' has been obtained.
2.4	ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
After solving a mathematical programming problem and
before performing sensitivity analysis, it is necessary to
find the set of the active constraints. These constraints
must satisfy Eqs. 2.3; furthermore, their gradients must be21QF:i zrr',AL! el-- y N:^

linearly independent, if one wants to obtain the Lagrange
multipliers from Eq. 2.10. The algorithm described below
was used with success.
i)Select an initial set S  of nearly satisfied
constraints by retaining those constraints whose
value is above a small negative tolerance.
ii)Identify S pa, the subset of S a which contains the
maximum number of constraints with independent
gradients. To achieve that, the constraint
gradients are taken as the columns of a rectangular
matrix and a Gaussian elimination with row and
column interchanges is performed to identify the
independent columns.
iii)Use Eq. 2.10 to find the Lagrange multipliers
corresponding to set S pa. Note that the fact that
the constraints of set Spa have independent
gradients is a guarantee that Eq. 2.10 has a
solution.
iv)Find the smallest Lagrange multiplier ai.
V)	If X. is negative (less than a small positive
tolerance), eliminate constraint i from set S  and
restart the process in ii). 	If X  is positive,
terminate the process since S'a is the desired set.22	'3F ? DR U` F_:
Note that steps ii) and iii) would not be required if QR
decomposition were used. In step v), only the constraints
with strictly positive Lagrange multipliers are kept, even
though active constraints may have Lagrange multipliers that
are zero. This is because constraints with zero Lagrange
multipliers are redundant; hence, their gradients are
linearly dependent on other constraint gradients.
In this work, the sensitivity derivatives are used to
extend optimization information over a range of variation
for the parameters of the design problems considered. This
is achieved by means of the linear extrapolations given in
Eq. 2.5. The implicit relationships 2.2 are expected to be
nonlinear, in general. Hence, the extrapolations being
first-order Taylor series expansions, they are valid only
for limited AP. Furthermore, the calculation of the
sensitivity derivatives is based on the assumption that the
set of constraints active at the initial optimum will remain
unchanged as the parameter P is changed to P+AP.
Perturbations of the parameters cause moves of the
constraint boundaries with respect to each other and,
therefore, may very well result in changes in the active
constraint set. These changes then imply reduced accuracy
of the extrapolated optima. The question arises of whether
it is possible to estimate the magnitude of the parameterOF POOR QvA° ITY
perturbations which cause changes in the active constraint
set. It was proposed in Ref. 22 that the perturbation of
parameter p (element of vector P) which results in
constraint i changing from active status to inactive status
may be obtained to the first order by stating that X  is
reduced to zero when constraint i leaves the active set,
Xi(P+APi) _ Xi(P)+Xi(P)APi = 0
or
Opi = -ai(P)/Xi(P)	(2.15)
Reference 22 likewise suggested that the perturbation of
parameter p causing constraint i to change from inactive
status to active status could be found as that value ep i for
which gi(p+Api) becomes zero.
gi(P+APi) = gi(P)+1gix(P)X'(P)1APi = 0
then
APi= -gi(P)/Igix( P)X'(P))	(2.16)
It was observed in Ref. 26 that Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 could be
unreliable. These estimates were used to determine with a
specific design problem example what parameter perturbations
cause changes in the status of the different constraints247^ "n
OF POOR QJAUTY
involved, attempting so to speak, to construct an history
of the active constraint set as p varies. This may not be
an appropriate approach. Indeed, Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 may be
used to estimate a Ap i for each of the problem constraints,
indicating when the status of a particular constraint is
supposed to change. However, only the smallest (in absolute
value) negative and positive of these dp i (Ap_ and 4p+)
should be taken into consideration. The extrapolations
based on sensitivity derivatives obtained at p should be
adequate for p+Ap - < p+pp 5 p+pp +, But any prediction
beyond that range (in particular prediction of change in the
active constraint set) should not be relied upon since it
would have been obtained with derivatives corresponding to
an inappropriate active constraint set. In essence, as
suggested in Ref. 23, the Ap i of Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 must be
regarded as bounds on Op. Barring excessive nonlinearity,
the range of ep defined by the intersection of these bounds
is that within which the extrapolations based on sensitivity
derivatives calculated at p should be reliable. 	In the
absence of changes in the active constraint set, the
accuracy of Eq. 	2.5 is limited only by the inherent
nonlinearity of the specific design problem considered.
Experiments conducted with various structural design
problems showed (Ref. 22) that linear-extrapolation-based25
N
estimates of optimum objective functions and design
variables fell within a few percent of actual optimization
result, for parameter variations of up to twenty percent;
the predictions often were better for the objective function
than for the design variables.(n^ niece,.

PRESENTATION OF THE ALGORITHM
This chapter is devoted to discussing an algorithm proposed
for the design of complex engineering systems. The method
is based on multilevel decomposition of the corresponding
design problems 	into	subproblems 	which	are	solved
separately. 	The algorithm is discussed in general terms.
This is done so as to avoid focusing on a particular
problem. 	The following chapter will be devoted to
investigating the applicability of the approach described
here to a specific problem. 	The abstract concepts
introduced here can be more easily put in a physical context
if this chapter and the following one are read
simultaneously. The presentation begins with a definition
of the type of multilevel decomposition considered and of
the components of that decomposition. Then, the discussion
centers on the formulation and solution of the subproblems.
Finally, the organization of the overall optimization is
discussed. 	The developments follow those by Sobieski in
Ref. 20.

3.1	DEFINITIONS
The starting point of this discussion is the task of
designing a system by finding a set of variables which
optimize a performance index while satisfying a number of
constraints. This will be referred to as the
overall problem. Assume that, for convenience, the overall
problem is decomposed into a number of subproblems, each of
which corresponds to the design of a subsystem, and has its
own sets of variables and constraints. The subproblems are
organized in a hierarchy as shown on Fig. 1. The subproblem
at the top of the hierarchy is the design of the whole
system, in very general terms. The next level deals with
major subsystems, the third one with subsystems of the major
subsystems, and so on. As one goes down the levels, the
details of the system become more and more precisely
defined. The subproblems are identified by two numbers ij
which define (i) the level of the subproblem, and (j) its
position on that level. 	The level numbers increase
downward, and the subproblem numbers increase, say, from
left to right. The hierarchy is assumed to have 1 levels,
there are n  subproblems on level i.
The whole design process is conducted iteratively,
starting at the highest level and going down. 	Each
subsystem is designed separately. 	The object of the
algorithm is to coordinate the design of the different28

subsystems so as to obtain optimum system performance by
resolving the trade-offs between the subsystems in a
rational fashion. This is achieved by manipulating two
types of interactions between the subproblems: the controls
and the responses. A control is a quantity selected in a
subproblem to influence another subproblem in the hierarchy.
A response is a quantity that reflects the effect the design
of one subproblem has on that of another subproblem. In
this work, we assume that the controls flow exclusively
downward in the hierarchy, while the responses flow
exclusively upward. This excludes situations where a
subproblem controls another subproblem on the same level
(lateral control) or on a higher level (reverse control).'
As represented symbolically on Fig. 2, each subproblem is
assumed to receive controls from higher level subproblems
through vector CI ij (control inputs in subproblem if), and
to receive responses from lower level subproblems through
vector RIij (response inputs in subproblem i1). Also, each
subproblem is assumed to control lower level subproblems
with vector COij (control outputs from subproblem i^), and
' In Ref. 20, the controls are named interaction quantities.
The interested reader should refer to that source for
indications as to how to handle reverse and lateral
controls.c) Highest level subproblem.

to respond to higher level subproblems with vector ROij
(response outputs from subproblem ice). This discussion does
not make any assumption on the specific form of the
controls, except that the control outputs from a subproblem
depend on the variables of that subproblem; they may be the
variables themselves or functions of these variables (CO .j =i
Coij(Xij)). Likewise, the controls imposed on subproblem ij
(CI ij) are not specified , except that they are assumed
known once all the control outputs from higher level
subproblems (Co ri, a<i) are known. The response outputs
from a subproblem (RO ij) will be defined in this chapter.
Furthermore, it will be shown that the response inputs into
a subproblem (RI ij) are entirely known once the response
outputs from the lower level subproblems (RO as, a>i) are
known.
For each iteration of the overall system, each subproblem
is concerned with finding a design which satisfies its own
constraints for the controls specified by the higher level
subproblems (CI ij). In addition, the subproblem manipulates
its own controls (CO..) so as to improve the responses from
the lower level subproblems (RI ij ).	Mathematically, this
implies finding a design vector that satisfies a set of0"KY A p P cn- n
32	OF POOR QUALITY
equality constraints and a set of inequality constraints.
This problem may be solved by transforming it into a
nonlinear mathematical programming problem where a measure
of constraint violation is minimized with respect to the
design vector. The subproblem's own response (RO ij) is then
constituted of the minimum measure of constraint violation
as well as derivatives indicating the sensitivity of that
minimum measure to changes in the controls imposed on the
subproblem.
The subproblem on the highest level of the hierarchy
drives the whole design process. It selects its own design
variables so as to optimize the overall problem performance
index and satisfy its own constraints. It adjusts its
controls (CO 11) to improve the responses from the lower
levels (RI 11), that is, reduce the constraint violation in
the lower level subproblems.
3.2 	 LOWEST LEVEL SUBPROBLEM
Figure 2 a) describes symbolically subproblem lj, a
subproblem on the lowest level of the hierarchy. The vector
of design variables is X lj, the subproblem design is
influenced by the controls collected in vector CI lj and the
subproblem response is vector RO lj.	The subproblem

The functions g lj and elj are vector-valued. The subproblem
design is subject to a set of inequality constraints (Eq.
3.1.a). These are the constraints set on the corresponding
subsystem in the statement of the overall non-decomposed
problem. The design is also subject to a set of equality
constraints (Eq. 3.1.b). Some of these may come from the
formulation of the overall non-decomposed problem; some are
imposed on the subproblem during decomposition. The
multilevel decomposition consists of different models of the
system being designed, the models becoming more refined as
one progresses down the hierarchy. The equality constraints
arise from the necessity of requiring consistency between
the models at different levels. Also, some upper and lower
bounds may be set on the variables (Eq. 3.1.c). As stated
in the previous section, the subproblem is assumed to be
controlled by each subproblem on the higher levels. As a
result, the vector of controls CI lj is functionally
dependent on the optimum designs of all the subproblems
above the lowest level.34

replaced by two inequality constraints (Eq. 3.3.c). The
distance between these constraints (2n ij ) is forced to
remain positive because of Eq. 3.3.e and to decrease because
of the second term in the objective function. 	Each
inequality constraint is relaxed by the addition of variable
E: mechanism of that relaxation is described in Fig.
3, for a simple two-dimensional problem with one equality
and three inequality constraints, assuming that the equality
constraint is identically satisfied. The first term in the
objective function (Eq. 3.3.a) is defined so as to increase
Eli . A high positive value for Eli is quite acceptable as
it means that the selected design point is deep inside the
feasible domain, away from the constraint boundaries, and
that decreases the chances of obtaining infeasible designs
when the controls are perturbed. If the solution of Problem
3.3 is so that Eli z 0 and Ti lj = 0, then it solves Problem
3.1. If, on the other hand, we have Elj < 0 or Ti lj x 0,
then the resulting design is infeasible with respect to
Problem 3.1.
Constant b is added to the definition of the objective
function to control the importance attributed to violatingOF POOP: QJA i"d Y
the different constraints. A high value for b results in a
heavy penalty paid for violating equality constraints;
conversely, a low value for b makes the penalty for
violating inequality constraints more important, in relative
terms. In addition to adjusting b, it may prove appropriate
to scale variables E1j and n1j in order to make all
components of the constraint gradients of the same order of
magnitude.
Any nonlinear programming algorithm may be used to solve
Problem 3.3. 	This yields X lj, as well as a measure of
inequality constraint violation E1j and a measure of
equality constraint violation n1j. These are functionally
dependent on the controls CI 1j and, therefore, as indicated
by Eq. 3.2, on the optimum design variables of subproblems
on higher levels. Optimum sensitivity analysis may be used
to study the effect changes in higher level subproblem
variables have on the constraint violations for subproblem
lj.	Considering £1j, if all higher level subproblem

DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTILEVEL OPTIMIZATION APPROACH TO THE DESIGN
OF MODERN ENGINEERING SYSTEMS
by
Jean-Francois Marie Barthelemy
(ABSTRACT)
This work describes an optimization approach to the design
of complex engineering systems. The approach assumes a
decomposition of the original problem (design of the system)
into smaller subproblems (design of subsystems) organized in
a multilevel hierarchy. As one goes down the levels, the
details of the system become more precisely defined;
furthermore, each subproblem may control the design of lower
level subproblems.
A general algorithm is proposed which carries out the
design process iteratively, starting at the top of the
hierarchy and proceeding downward. Each subproblem is
optimized separately for fixed controls from higher level
subproblems. 	An optimum sensitivity analysis is then
performed which determines the sensitivity of the subproblem
i0R1 GINAL PACE 13
OF POOR QUALITY
design to changes in higher level subproblem controls. The
resulting sensitivity derivatives are used to construct
constraints which force the controlling subproblems into
chosing their own designs so as to improve the lower level
subproblem designs while satisfying their own constraints.
The applicability of the proposed algorithm is
demonstrated by devising a four-level hierarchy to perform
the simultaneous aerodynamic and structural design_ of a
high-performance sailplane wing for maximum cross-country
speed.	The levels are devoted successively to selecting
global	performance parameters, 	determining 	the wing
aerodynamic shape, defining the spanwise distributions of
global structural characteristics, 	and, performing the
detailed design of wing substructures.
Finally, the concepts discussed are applied to the two-
level minimum weight structural design of the sailplane
wing. The numerical experiments show that discontinuities
in the sensitivity derivatives may delay convergence, but
that the algorithm is robust enough to overcome these
discontinuities and produce low-weight feasible designs,
regardless of whether the optimization is started from the
feasible space or the infeasible one.

INTRODUCTION
The design of modern engineering systems is a procedure
which often integrates different disciplines and always
involves a large number of variables. While optimization
techniques provide an attractive formal tool for carrying
out the design process, a weakness of these techniques
remains in their inability to handle 	truly large
multidisciplinary design problems. 	To overcome that
weakness, designers must resort to some sort of
decomposition method. The original design problem is broken
down into smaller subproblems which are then optimized
separately. However, these subproblems are generally
coupled so that an iterative scheme must be devised which
coordinates their optimization in order that the resulting
design is, to some extent, optimum with respect to the
original problem.
1.1	OVERVIEW OF EXISTING LITERATURE
Several studies have been devoted to decomposition of large
optimization problems. These studies pertain to all the
areas of engineering as well as economics and management.
The following overview focuses mainly on structuralOF POOR 	 eW
optimization. For the sake of the discussion, two classes
of decomposition methods are defined: formal methods and
intuitive methods. In formal methods, the mathematical
structure of the problem is exploited to arrive at a rigid
decomposition scheme. Consequently, a rigorous framework
exists within which the mathematical properties of the
method may be assessed. In intuitive methods, understanding
of the behavior of the physical system considered is
apparently the prime factor directing the decomposition.
These methods are sometimes referred to as rational methods
and their mathematical characteristics can seldom be studied
in great detail. An intuitive approach provides, of course,
the only option for decomposing those problems which do not
possess the structure for which a formal decomposition
method exists. This division into formal and intuitive
methods is somewhat arbitrary as a given approach may very
well be shown to belong to both classes; however,it
facilitates the discussion.
1.1.1	Formal Decomposition Methods
A very extensive body of work exists on decomposition in
linear programming (LP). The existence of truly large
problems in the fields of economics and operations research
has stimulated efforts aiming at exploiting the specialOF, POOR ft:{rv^ a ^}^^
structures of the constraint matrix. The major initial step
in that area seems to have been the introduction of the
Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle in 1960. By 1970 the
developments in this active field were so numerous as to
warrant the publication of a textbook by Lasdon (Ref. 1).
In the area of structural design, problems involving
collapse design of trusses and frames were solved
successfully using the LP decomposition techniques (Refs.
2-5).
Dynamic programming (DP) was discussed by Bellman as
early as 1957 (Ref. 6). 	It is a decomposition method
suitable for nonlinear problems. The problems must be
serial, that is, of the form such that any change in the
design of one subproblem affects only those subproblems that
are	"downstream" 	in	the	decision-making 	process.
Furthermore, the problem objective function must be
additive. However, DP cannot easily handle constraints that
involve more than one subproblem. Also, it becomes very
expensive if there are large amounts of data transmitted
between successive subproblems. Among the advantages of the
DP method are its capability to generate global optimum
designs and to handle discrete variables and discontinuous
functions. In structural design, dynamic programming seems
to find use in optimization of "one-dimensional" structures,OF POOR QU ? €TV
N
that is, beams, one-bay multistory or one-story multibay
frames, and transmission towers (see Ref. 7 Chap. XI or Ref.
8).
Optimization algorithms were devised for separable
nonlinear problems using coordination techniques developed
in the context of multilevel decision-making processes.
Once a problem has been decomposed into smaller subproblems,
the main task is to coordinate the design of the different
subproblems. Essentially, the subproblems are grouped on
the lower level of a hierarchy and an additional higher
level subproblem is added whose role is to select the values
of coordinating variables so as to force the other
subproblems into choosing designs corresponding to improved
overall problem performance. The coordinating subproblem is
itself cast in the form of an optimization problem. As the
evaluation of the objective function of the coordinating
subproblem requires complete optimization of all lower level
subproblems, this type of algorithm may turn out to be very
expensive. A study of coordination in hierarchical systems
is given in the 1970 monograph by Mesarovic and coauthors
(Ref. 9). Kirsch and coworkers have used both the model
coordination technique and the goal coordination technique
to solve various structural design problems (Ref. 7 Chap. X
and Refs. 10-12)1.1.2	Intuitive Decomposition Methods
The first attempts at developing intuitive decomposition
schemes for large structural design problems were extensions
of the fully stressed design method. In these approaches
the structure is seen as a combination of elements
(substructures). 	Given an initial design for all the
elements, an analysis of the structure is made to determine
inter-element forces. 	Then, each element is optimized
separately on the assumption that changes in that element
design do not change inter-element forces. Once all the
elements have ,been designed, the structure is analyzed again
and the process repeated until convergence is achieved.
Giles (Ref. 13) and Sobieski (Ref. 14) performed the design
of airplane wings under constraints on stresses and element
stability using that approach. Kirsch and coworkers (Ref.
15) designed frameworks using a similar approach but
reanalyzing 	the	structure 	after	each	substructure
optimization, 	in order to account better for load
redistribution.
When optimizing a structure one substructure at a time,
it is difficult to handle global constraints, that is, those
constraints affected by variables belonging to more than one
substructure. In Ref. 16, Sobieski and Loendorf designed
airplane fuselages under local constraints on stresses and6
OF P'^JCR
local instabilities and global constraints on fuselage
elastic displacements. The optimization was first carried
out with the local constraints, as described above. If
necessary, the resulting design was subsequently modified to
satisfy the displacement constraints using a unit load
method to determine the impact that changes in element
design have on the violated displacements. Another example
of treatment of global constraints is given by Hughes and
coworkers (Ref. 17) who designed ship compartments for
minimum cost under constraints on stresses.
A generalized fully stressed design approach to large
problems is certainly economically appealing. However, it
presents two difficulties. As pointed out in Ref. 14
"...minimization of the individual component masses does not
guarantee minimization of the total mass This situation
is caused by the inability to control the load path on the
assembled structure level... ." As mentioned earlier also,
it makes it difficult to handle global constraints. 	In
Refs. 18 and 19 Schmit and coworkers used a two-level
approach to design trusses and aircraft wings. At the
global level, the distributions of stiffnesses, the global
level variables, were chosen so as to minimize the total
structural weight, while satisfying global displacement
constraints and also some local constraints on stresses andORIGINA L PAGE @S 	7
OF POOR QUALITY
structural element buckling. For known stiffnesses, the end
forces on the various structural elements were calculated.
At the local level, these structural elements were optimized
separately with respect to their detail design, the local
level variables, so that the changes in element stiffnesses
were minimized, while the local constraints were still
satisfied. The process was repeated until convergence was
achieved. In this decomposition, the introduction of the
global level problem was a key factor in overcoming both
difficulties . attributed to the generalized fully stressed
design approach. By placing the minimization of the weight
at the global level, the opportunity was kept to trade
structural mass between the elements in order to improve the
load paths while reducing the total weight. 	Also, the
provision was left to explicitly handle global constraints.
1.1.3	General Approach to Engineering System Design
The intuitive decomposition methods discussed to this point
are very specific and cannot easily be extended to different
classes of problems. In particular, they are not suited for
multidisciplinary problems. In Ref. 20, Sobieski proposed a
general approach to the design of large engineering systems,
and in Ref. 21, he proceeded to demonstrate the proposed
concepts by applying them to the two-level minimum weight8	 ORIGINAL RAGE IS
OF POOR QUALITY
design of a portal framework under local constraints on
stresses and local buckling and global constraints on
displacement. At the global level, the weight of the
framework is minimized with respect to the cross-sectional
area and bending moment of inertia of the different beams,
while satisfying constraints on displacements. Once a
global design is obtained, the framework is analyzed to
obtain the end loads on the beams. At the local level, each
beam is designed separately. Its detailed dimensions are
proportioned so as achieve the values of cross-sectional
area and bending moment of inertia chosen at the global
level while satisfying constraints on stresses and local
buckling. 	This is done by minimizing a measure of the
violation of the subproblem constraints. An optimum
sensitivity analysis (Ref. 22) is then performed in order to
obtain a linear approximation to the constraint violation of
each local level subproblem in terms of the global level
variables. The whole optimization is repeated, but, at the
global level, it is required that the (linearized) local
level constraint violations be reduced. This iterative
process is pursued until all the local and global level
constraints are satisfied and the framework weight cannot be
reduced further. Although the proposed scheme is applied to
a structural synthesis problem, it is applicable to any typeOt;i 	 L	r,	
9
OF POOP QUALITY
of engineering design. Furthermore, it may be used with
decompositions involving more than two levels. Some of the
key features of the approach are discussed below.
The method postulates a multilevel decomposition of the
problem, that is, a decomposition where the different
subproblems are grouped on the levels of a hierarchy. The
subproblem at the top level is concerned with the
optimization of the overall system objective in terms of
design variables describing that system in very global
terms. As one proceeds down the hierarchy, the subproblems
are dealing wi~h subsystems described in deeper and deeper
levels of detail. The choice of the specifics of the
decomposition for a given application still remains largely
a matter of physical insight and convenience.
Below the highest level, each subproblem is concerned
with finding a set of design variables which satisfy its own
constraints for fixed values of higher level variables. It
turns out that this amounts to finding a design vector which
satisfies a set of equality constraints and a set of
inequality constraints. Such a mathematical problem may not
have a solution. It may be transformed into a mathematical
programming problem which maximizes a measure of "how well"
the design satisfies the sets of constraints. The
subproblem formulation of Ref. 21 uses the equality10
ORIGINAL PAGE 19
OF POOR QUALITY
constraints to eliminate dependent variables and forms a
penalty function with the inequality constraints. That
penalty function is a measure of constraint violation which
is then minimized with respect to the independent variables
to find that design which best meets the constraints.
Once designs are obtained for all the subproblems on a
given level, sensitivity analyses are performed to determine
the effect changes in higher level variables have on lower
level constraint violations. The resulting sensitivity
derivatives are used to construct linear approximations to
the lower subproblem constraint violations in terms of the
higher level design variables. 	These approximations are
added as constraints for the next optimization of the higher
level subproblems. This enables the optimization of the
higher level subproblems to be conducted so as to improve
the design of the lower level subproblems which have
violated constraints or so as to reduce the margin of
satisfaction for those subproblems for which all constraints
are amply satisfied. In essence, this makes the trade-offs
between the different subproblems visible and allows them to
be resolved in a rational fashion.
The task of the highest level subproblem remains the
optimization of the system performance index with respect to
its own global variables which are required not only toI= POOR QUALITY
satisfy its own constraints but also to reduce the
constraint violation for the lower level subproblems.
1.2	OUTLINE
The purpose of this work has been to investigate the
applicability of Sobieski's method to the design of complex,
multidisciplinary engineering systems. It was elected to
focus the effort on a specific example: the simultaneous
aerodynamic and structural design of a high-performance
sailplane wing for maximum cross-country speed. 	It was
determined that this design problem could be carried out by
means of a four-level decomposition. An algorithm was
developed to solve the problem and it was tested on the two
lower levels of the decomposition.
In Chapter II, we discuss the optimum sensitivity
analysis technique. We show that the stationary conditions
satisfied at a local constrained optimum may be used to
determine the sensitivity of optimum objective functions and
design variables to changes in those parameters that were
kept fixed during the optimization.
Chapter III is devoted to a detailed description of the
proposed algorithm. It is constructed along the same lines
as that described in Ref. 20. The main difference resides
with the specifics of the mathematical formulation for the12
OF pOOR QUALITY
individual subproblems. The present algorithm treats
equality constraints in a general numerical fashion.
Furthermore, it is designed as a constrained programming
problem rather than as a penalty function minimization
problem. Particular attention is paid to the potential
difficulties associated with decompositions that involve
more than two levels.
In Chapter IV, the decomposition proposed for the example
problem is detailed. It is a four-level decomposition. The
highest level subproblem entails selection of global
performance parameters which include weight and aerodynamic
characteristics. Then follows an aerodynamic subproblem
where the shape of the wing is defined so as to obtain the
aerodynamic characteristics specified in the performance
subproblem and control the initiation bf stall. On the
third level of the decomposition is a global structural
subproblem where the wing -spanwise distributions of weight
and stiffnesses are selected for fixed total weight and so
as to limit the wing bending response and torsional
divergence speed. Finally, at the lowest level, the wing is
modeled by a series of spanwise elements each of which is
designed separately for fixed weight and stiffnesses under
stress and local buckling constraints.
sl13
In Chapter V, the algorithm introduced in Chap. III is
applied to the two lower levels of the hierarchy described
in Chap. IV. The problem solved is the minimum weight
design of a straight composite wing. Results are given for
designs started from both the feasible space and the
infeasible space.
Finally, Chapter VI is devoted to synthesizing the
experience gained with this work and making recommendations
for continued investigation.OF POOR QJHLi d V

SUMMARY OF PERTINENT RESULTS FROM OPTIMUM
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Optimum sensitivity analysis is a technique which permits
one to investigate the sensitivity of the solution of an
optimization problem to variations in the parameters of the
problem. It yields derivatives of the optimum values of the
design variables and objective function with respect to the
parameters, derivatives which may then be used to perform
trade-off analyses. These derivatives are called
sensitivity derivatives to distinguish them from the
derivatives of objective function and constraints with
respect to the design variables which are termed behavior
derivatives. 	This technique was recently introduced by
Sobieski and coauthors (Ref. 22) as a tool for structural
synthesis. It has been specialized by Schmit and Chang
(Ref. 23) to a formulation of the problem of structural
sizing for mimimum weight based on approximation concepts
and dual methods, and has been used by Haftka (Ref.  24 ) in
the optimization of damage tolerant structures. The
elements of the technique required for the remainder of this
work are discussed in this chapter; the reader interested in
a more general discussion should consult Ref. 22.

Equation 2.11 represents k sets of m a linear equations in n

values to n-m a components of each column of Y and deduce the
remaining m a components from Eq. 2.11. In general, Y
differs from the true sensitivity derivatives of the
variables X' , unless n = m a. Assume that, in the space of
the design variables X, an infinitesimal perturbation of
parameter P results in a move from the initial point in the
direction specified by Y. Then, the resulting design is
still at the intersection of the originally active
constraints because condition 2.7 is enforced; however, it
may not be optimum because the first of Eqs. 2.3 may not be

The approach of Sec. 2.2 yields the exact value of F' at
considerably lower cost than that of Sec. 2.3 since it
involves only first-order partial derivatives of F and q 
with respect to the design variables and parameters of the
problem. However, it does not usually permit one to obtain
X' (unless n = m a). The choice between the two types of
analysis is very much dependent on the application
considered and the nature of the optimization problem at
hand. It must be guided by a comparison between the cost of
calculating second-order partial derivatives of F and g  on
the one hand, and the benefit of knowing the sensitivity
derivatives of the variables on the other hand.
It must be noted that higher order sensitivity
derivatives may be obtained for X F and X by setting
higher order total derivatives of the two first stationary
conditions (Eqs. 2.3) to zero. In particular, Ref. 25 shows
how little additional calculation is required to find F",
once X' has been obtained.
2.4	ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
After solving a mathematical programming problem and
before performing sensitivity analysis, it is necessary to
find the set of the active constraints. These constraints
must satisfy Eqs. 2.3; furthermore, their gradients must be21QF:i zrr',AL! el-- y N:^

linearly independent, if one wants to obtain the Lagrange
multipliers from Eq. 2.10. The algorithm described below
was used with success.
i)Select an initial set S  of nearly satisfied
constraints by retaining those constraints whose
value is above a small negative tolerance.
ii)Identify S pa, the subset of S a which contains the
maximum number of constraints with independent
gradients. To achieve that, the constraint
gradients are taken as the columns of a rectangular
matrix and a Gaussian elimination with row and
column interchanges is performed to identify the
independent columns.
iii)Use Eq. 2.10 to find the Lagrange multipliers
corresponding to set S pa. Note that the fact that
the constraints of set Spa have independent
gradients is a guarantee that Eq. 2.10 has a
solution.
iv)Find the smallest Lagrange multiplier ai.
V)	If X. is negative (less than a small positive
tolerance), eliminate constraint i from set S  and
restart the process in ii). 	If X  is positive,
terminate the process since S'a is the desired set.22	'3F ? DR U` F_:
Note that steps ii) and iii) would not be required if QR
decomposition were used. In step v), only the constraints
with strictly positive Lagrange multipliers are kept, even
though active constraints may have Lagrange multipliers that
are zero. This is because constraints with zero Lagrange
multipliers are redundant; hence, their gradients are
linearly dependent on other constraint gradients.
In this work, the sensitivity derivatives are used to
extend optimization information over a range of variation
for the parameters of the design problems considered. This
is achieved by means of the linear extrapolations given in
Eq. 2.5. The implicit relationships 2.2 are expected to be
nonlinear, in general. Hence, the extrapolations being
first-order Taylor series expansions, they are valid only
for limited AP. Furthermore, the calculation of the
sensitivity derivatives is based on the assumption that the
set of constraints active at the initial optimum will remain
unchanged as the parameter P is changed to P+AP.
Perturbations of the parameters cause moves of the
constraint boundaries with respect to each other and,
therefore, may very well result in changes in the active
constraint set. These changes then imply reduced accuracy
of the extrapolated optima. The question arises of whether
it is possible to estimate the magnitude of the parameterOF POOR QvA° ITY
perturbations which cause changes in the active constraint
set. It was proposed in Ref. 22 that the perturbation of
parameter p (element of vector P) which results in
constraint i changing from active status to inactive status
may be obtained to the first order by stating that X  is
reduced to zero when constraint i leaves the active set,
Xi(P+APi) _ Xi(P)+Xi(P)APi = 0
or
Opi = -ai(P)/Xi(P)	(2.15)
Reference 22 likewise suggested that the perturbation of
parameter p causing constraint i to change from inactive
status to active status could be found as that value ep i for
which gi(p+Api) becomes zero.
gi(P+APi) = gi(P)+1gix(P)X'(P)1APi = 0
then
APi= -gi(P)/Igix( P)X'(P))	(2.16)
It was observed in Ref. 26 that Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 could be
unreliable. These estimates were used to determine with a
specific design problem example what parameter perturbations
cause changes in the status of the different constraints247^ "n
OF POOR QJAUTY
involved, attempting so to speak, to construct an history
of the active constraint set as p varies. This may not be
an appropriate approach. Indeed, Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 may be
used to estimate a Ap i for each of the problem constraints,
indicating when the status of a particular constraint is
supposed to change. However, only the smallest (in absolute
value) negative and positive of these dp i (Ap_ and 4p+)
should be taken into consideration. The extrapolations
based on sensitivity derivatives obtained at p should be
adequate for p+Ap - < p+pp 5 p+pp +, But any prediction
beyond that range (in particular prediction of change in the
active constraint set) should not be relied upon since it
would have been obtained with derivatives corresponding to
an inappropriate active constraint set. In essence, as
suggested in Ref. 23, the Ap i of Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 must be
regarded as bounds on Op. Barring excessive nonlinearity,
the range of ep defined by the intersection of these bounds
is that within which the extrapolations based on sensitivity
derivatives calculated at p should be reliable. 	In the
absence of changes in the active constraint set, the
accuracy of Eq. 	2.5 is limited only by the inherent
nonlinearity of the specific design problem considered.
Experiments conducted with various structural design
problems showed (Ref. 22) that linear-extrapolation-based25

estimates of optimum objective functions and design
variables fell within a few percent of actual optimization
result, for parameter variations of up to twenty percent;
the predictions often were better for the objective function
than for the design variables.(n^ niece,.

PRESENTATION OF THE ALGORITHM
This chapter is devoted to discussing an algorithm proposed
for the design of complex engineering systems. The method
is based on multilevel decomposition of the corresponding
design problems 	into	subproblems 	which	are	solved
separately. 	The algorithm is discussed in general terms.
This is done so as to avoid focusing on a particular
problem. 	The following chapter will be devoted to
investigating the applicability of the approach described
here to a specific problem. 	The abstract concepts
introduced here can be more easily put in a physical context
if this chapter and the following one are read
simultaneously. The presentation begins with a definition
of the type of multilevel decomposition considered and of
the components of that decomposition. Then, the discussion
centers on the formulation and solution of the subproblems.
Finally, the organization of the overall optimization is
discussed. 	The developments follow those by Sobieski in
Ref. 20.

3.1	DEFINITIONS
The starting point of this discussion is the task of
designing a system by finding a set of variables which
optimize a performance index while satisfying a number of
constraints. This will be referred to as the
overall problem. Assume that, for convenience, the overall
problem is decomposed into a number of subproblems, each of
which corresponds to the design of a subsystem, and has its
own sets of variables and constraints. The subproblems are
organized in a hierarchy as shown on Fig. 1. The subproblem
at the top of the hierarchy is the design of the whole
system, in very general terms. The next level deals with
major subsystems, the third one with subsystems of the major
subsystems, and so on. As one goes down the levels, the
details of the system become more and more precisely
defined. The subproblems are identified by two numbers ij
which define (i) the level of the subproblem, and (j) its
position on that level. 	The level numbers increase
downward, and the subproblem numbers increase, say, from
left to right. The hierarchy is assumed to have 1 levels,
there are n  subproblems on level i.
The whole design process is conducted iteratively,
starting at the highest level and going down. 	Each
subsystem is designed separately. 	The object of the
algorithm is to coordinate the design of the different28

subsystems so as to obtain optimum system performance by
resolving the trade-offs between the subsystems in a
rational fashion. This is achieved by manipulating two
types of interactions between the subproblems: the controls
and the responses. A control is a quantity selected in a
subproblem to influence another subproblem in the hierarchy.
A response is a quantity that reflects the effect the design
of one subproblem has on that of another subproblem. In
this work, we assume that the controls flow exclusively
downward in the hierarchy, while the responses flow
exclusively upward. This excludes situations where a
subproblem controls another subproblem on the same level
(lateral control) or on a higher level (reverse control).'
As represented symbolically on Fig. 2, each subproblem is
assumed to receive controls from higher level subproblems
through vector CI ij (control inputs in subproblem if), and
to receive responses from lower level subproblems through
vector RIij (response inputs in subproblem i1). Also, each
subproblem is assumed to control lower level subproblems
with vector COij (control outputs from subproblem i^), and
' In Ref. 20, the controls are named interaction quantities.
The interested reader should refer to that source for
indications as to how to handle reverse and lateral
controls.c) Highest level subproblem.

to respond to higher level subproblems with vector ROij
(response outputs from subproblem ice). This discussion does
not make any assumption on the specific form of the
controls, except that the control outputs from a subproblem
depend on the variables of that subproblem; they may be the
variables themselves or functions of these variables (CO .j =i
Coij(Xij)). Likewise, the controls imposed on subproblem ij
(CI ij) are not specified , except that they are assumed
known once all the control outputs from higher level
subproblems (Co ri, a<i) are known. The response outputs
from a subproblem (RO ij) will be defined in this chapter.
Furthermore, it will be shown that the response inputs into
a subproblem (RI ij) are entirely known once the response
outputs from the lower level subproblems (RO as, a>i) are
known.
For each iteration of the overall system, each subproblem
is concerned with finding a design which satisfies its own
constraints for the controls specified by the higher level
subproblems (CI ij). In addition, the subproblem manipulates
its own controls (CO..) so as to improve the responses from
the lower level subproblems (RI ij ).	Mathematically, this
implies finding a design vector that satisfies a set of0"KY A p P cn- n
32	OF POOR QUALITY
equality constraints and a set of inequality constraints.
This problem may be solved by transforming it into a
nonlinear mathematical programming problem where a measure
of constraint violation is minimized with respect to the
design vector. The subproblem's own response (RO ij) is then
constituted of the minimum measure of constraint violation
as well as derivatives indicating the sensitivity of that
minimum measure to changes in the controls imposed on the
subproblem.
The subproblem on the highest level of the hierarchy
drives the whole design process. It selects its own design
variables so as to optimize the overall problem performance
index and satisfy its own constraints. It adjusts its
controls (CO 11) to improve the responses from the lower
levels (RI 11), that is, reduce the constraint violation in
the lower level subproblems.
3.2 	 LOWEST LEVEL SUBPROBLEM
Figure 2 a) describes symbolically subproblem lj, a
subproblem on the lowest level of the hierarchy. The vector
of design variables is X lj, the subproblem design is
influenced by the controls collected in vector CI lj and the
subproblem response is vector RO lj.	The subproblem

The functions g lj and elj are vector-valued. The subproblem
design is subject to a set of inequality constraints (Eq.
3.1.a). These are the constraints set on the corresponding
subsystem in the statement of the overall non-decomposed
problem. The design is also subject to a set of equality
constraints (Eq. 3.1.b). Some of these may come from the
formulation of the overall non-decomposed problem; some are
imposed on the subproblem during decomposition. The
multilevel decomposition consists of different models of the
system being designed, the models becoming more refined as
one progresses down the hierarchy. The equality constraints
arise from the necessity of requiring consistency between
the models at different levels. Also, some upper and lower
bounds may be set on the variables (Eq. 3.1.c). As stated
in the previous section, the subproblem is assumed to be
controlled by each subproblem on the higher levels. As a
result, the vector of controls CI lj is functionally
dependent on the optimum designs of all the subproblems

where b is a positive constant. Each equality constraint is
replaced by two inequality constraints (Eq. 3.3.c). The
distance between these constraints (2n ij ) is forced to
remain positive because of Eq. 3.3.e and to decrease because
of the second term in the objective function. 	Each
inequality constraint is relaxed by the addition of variable
E: mechanism of that relaxation is described in Fig.
3, for a simple two-dimensional problem with one equality
and three inequality constraints, assuming that the equality
constraint is identically satisfied. The first term in the
objective function (Eq. 3.3.a) is defined so as to increase
Eli . A high positive value for Eli is quite acceptable as
it means that the selected design point is deep inside the
feasible domain, away from the constraint boundaries, and
that decreases the chances of obtaining infeasible designs
when the controls are perturbed. If the solution of Problem
3.3 is so that Eli z 0 and Ti lj = 0, then it solves Problem
3.1. If, on the other hand, we have Elj < 0 or Ti lj x 0,
then the resulting design is infeasible with respect to
Problem 3.1.
Constant b is added to the definition of the objective
function to control the importance attributed to violatingOF POOP: QJA i"d Y
the different constraints. A high value for b results in a
heavy penalty paid for violating equality constraints;
conversely, a low value for b makes the penalty for
violating inequality constraints more important, in relative
terms. In addition to adjusting b, it may prove appropriate
to scale variables E1j and n1j in order to make all
components of the constraint gradients of the same order of
magnitude.
Any nonlinear programming algorithm may be used to solve
Problem 3.3. 	This yields X lj, as well as a measure of
inequality constraint violation E1j and a measure of
equality constraint violation n1j. These are functionally
dependent on the controls CI 1j and, therefore, as indicated
by Eq. 3.2, on the optimum design variables of subproblems
on higher levels. Optimum sensitivity analysis may be used
to study the effect changes in higher level subproblem
variables have on the constraint violations for subproblem
lj.	Considering £1j, if all higher level subproblem

DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTILEVEL OPTIMIZATION APPROACH TO THE DESIGN
OF MODERN ENGINEERING SYSTEMS
by
Jean-Francois Marie Barthelemy
(ABSTRACT)
This work describes an optimization approach to the design
of complex engineering systems. The approach assumes a
decomposition of the original problem (design of the system)
into smaller subproblems (design of subsystems) organized in
a multilevel hierarchy. As one goes down the levels, the
details of the system become more precisely defined;
furthermore, each subproblem may control the design of lower
level subproblems.
A general algorithm is proposed which carries out the
design process iteratively, starting at the top of the
hierarchy and proceeding downward. Each subproblem is
optimized separately for fixed controls from higher level
subproblems. 	An optimum sensitivity analysis is then
performed which determines the sensitivity of the subproblem
i0R1 GINAL PACE 13
OF POOR QUALITY
design to changes in higher level subproblem controls. The
resulting sensitivity derivatives are used to construct
constraints which force the controlling subproblems into
chosing their own designs so as to improve the lower level
subproblem designs while satisfying their own constraints.
The applicability of the proposed algorithm is
demonstrated by devising a four-level hierarchy to perform
the simultaneous aerodynamic and structural design_ of a
high-performance sailplane wing for maximum cross-country
speed.	The levels are devoted successively to selecting
global	performance parameters, 	determining 	the wing
aerodynamic shape, defining the spanwise distributions of
global structural characteristics, 	and, performing the
detailed design of wing substructures.
Finally, the concepts discussed are applied to the two-
level minimum weight structural design of the sailplane
wing. The numerical experiments show that discontinuities
in the sensitivity derivatives may delay convergence, but
that the algorithm is robust enough to overcome these
discontinuities and produce low-weight feasible designs,
regardless of whether the optimization is started from the
feasible space or the infeasible one.

INTRODUCTION
The design of modern engineering systems is a procedure
which often integrates different disciplines and always
involves a large number of variables. While optimization
techniques provide an attractive formal tool for carrying
out the design process, a weakness of these techniques
remains in their inability to handle 	truly large
multidisciplinary design problems. 	To overcome that
weakness, designers must resort to some sort of
decomposition method. The original design problem is broken
down into smaller subproblems which are then optimized
separately. However, these subproblems are generally
coupled so that an iterative scheme must be devised which
coordinates their optimization in order that the resulting
design is, to some extent, optimum with respect to the
original problem.
1.1	OVERVIEW OF EXISTING LITERATURE
Several studies have been devoted to decomposition of large
optimization problems. These studies pertain to all the
areas of engineering as well as economics and management.
The following overview focuses mainly on structuralOF POOR 	 eW
optimization. For the sake of the discussion, two classes
of decomposition methods are defined: formal methods and
intuitive methods. In formal methods, the mathematical
structure of the problem is exploited to arrive at a rigid
decomposition scheme. Consequently, a rigorous framework
exists within which the mathematical properties of the
method may be assessed. In intuitive methods, understanding
of the behavior of the physical system considered is
apparently the prime factor directing the decomposition.
These methods are sometimes referred to as rational methods
and their mathematical characteristics can seldom be studied
in great detail. An intuitive approach provides, of course,
the only option for decomposing those problems which do not
possess the structure for which a formal decomposition
method exists. This division into formal and intuitive
methods is somewhat arbitrary as a given approach may very
well be shown to belong to both classes; however,it
facilitates the discussion.
1.1.1	Formal Decomposition Methods
A very extensive body of work exists on decomposition in
linear programming (LP). The existence of truly large
problems in the fields of economics and operations research
has stimulated efforts aiming at exploiting the specialOF, POOR ft:{rv^ a ^}^^
structures of the constraint matrix. The major initial step
in that area seems to have been the introduction of the
Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle in 1960. By 1970 the
developments in this active field were so numerous as to
warrant the publication of a textbook by Lasdon (Ref. 1).
In the area of structural design, problems involving
collapse design of trusses and frames were solved
successfully using the LP decomposition techniques (Refs.
2-5).
Dynamic programming (DP) was discussed by Bellman as
early as 1957 (Ref. 6). 	It is a decomposition method
suitable for nonlinear problems. The problems must be
serial, that is, of the form such that any change in the
design of one subproblem affects only those subproblems that
are	"downstream" 	in	the	decision-making 	process.
Furthermore, the problem objective function must be
additive. However, DP cannot easily handle constraints that
involve more than one subproblem. Also, it becomes very
expensive if there are large amounts of data transmitted
between successive subproblems. Among the advantages of the
DP method are its capability to generate global optimum
designs and to handle discrete variables and discontinuous
functions. In structural design, dynamic programming seems
to find use in optimization of "one-dimensional" structures,OF POOR QU ? €TV
N
that is, beams, one-bay multistory or one-story multibay
frames, and transmission towers (see Ref. 7 Chap. XI or Ref.
8).
Optimization algorithms were devised for separable
nonlinear problems using coordination techniques developed
in the context of multilevel decision-making processes.
Once a problem has been decomposed into smaller subproblems,
the main task is to coordinate the design of the different
subproblems. Essentially, the subproblems are grouped on
the lower level of a hierarchy and an additional higher
level subproblem is added whose role is to select the values
of coordinating variables so as to force the other
subproblems into choosing designs corresponding to improved
overall problem performance. The coordinating subproblem is
itself cast in the form of an optimization problem. As the
evaluation of the objective function of the coordinating
subproblem requires complete optimization of all lower level
subproblems, this type of algorithm may turn out to be very
expensive. A study of coordination in hierarchical systems
is given in the 1970 monograph by Mesarovic and coauthors
(Ref. 9). Kirsch and coworkers have used both the model
coordination technique and the goal coordination technique
to solve various structural design problems (Ref. 7 Chap. X
and Refs. 10-12)1.1.2	Intuitive Decomposition Methods
The first attempts at developing intuitive decomposition
schemes for large structural design problems were extensions
of the fully stressed design method. In these approaches
the structure is seen as a combination of elements
(substructures). 	Given an initial design for all the
elements, an analysis of the structure is made to determine
inter-element forces. 	Then, each element is optimized
separately on the assumption that changes in that element
design do not change inter-element forces. Once all the
elements have ,been designed, the structure is analyzed again
and the process repeated until convergence is achieved.
Giles (Ref. 13) and Sobieski (Ref. 14) performed the design
of airplane wings under constraints on stresses and element
stability using that approach. Kirsch and coworkers (Ref.
15) designed frameworks using a similar approach but
reanalyzing 	the	structure 	after	each	substructure
optimization, 	in order to account better for load
redistribution.
When optimizing a structure one substructure at a time,
it is difficult to handle global constraints, that is, those
constraints affected by variables belonging to more than one
substructure. In Ref. 16, Sobieski and Loendorf designed
airplane fuselages under local constraints on stresses and6
OF P'^JCR
local instabilities and global constraints on fuselage
elastic displacements. The optimization was first carried
out with the local constraints, as described above. If
necessary, the resulting design was subsequently modified to
satisfy the displacement constraints using a unit load
method to determine the impact that changes in element
design have on the violated displacements. Another example
of treatment of global constraints is given by Hughes and
coworkers (Ref. 17) who designed ship compartments for
minimum cost under constraints on stresses.
A generalized fully stressed design approach to large
problems is certainly economically appealing. However, it
presents two difficulties. As pointed out in Ref. 14
"...minimization of the individual component masses does not
guarantee minimization of the total mass This situation
is caused by the inability to control the load path on the
assembled structure level... ." As mentioned earlier also,
it makes it difficult to handle global constraints. 	In
Refs. 18 and 19 Schmit and coworkers used a two-level
approach to design trusses and aircraft wings. At the
global level, the distributions of stiffnesses, the global
level variables, were chosen so as to minimize the total
structural weight, while satisfying global displacement
constraints and also some local constraints on stresses andORIGINA L PAGE @S 	7
OF POOR QUALITY
structural element buckling. For known stiffnesses, the end
forces on the various structural elements were calculated.
At the local level, these structural elements were optimized
separately with respect to their detail design, the local
level variables, so that the changes in element stiffnesses
were minimized, while the local constraints were still
satisfied. The process was repeated until convergence was
achieved. In this decomposition, the introduction of the
global level problem was a key factor in overcoming both
difficulties . attributed to the generalized fully stressed
design approach. By placing the minimization of the weight
at the global level, the opportunity was kept to trade
structural mass between the elements in order to improve the
load paths while reducing the total weight. 	Also, the
provision was left to explicitly handle global constraints.
1.1.3	General Approach to Engineering System Design
The intuitive decomposition methods discussed to this point
are very specific and cannot easily be extended to different
classes of problems. In particular, they are not suited for
multidisciplinary problems. In Ref. 20, Sobieski proposed a
general approach to the design of large engineering systems,
and in Ref. 21, he proceeded to demonstrate the proposed
concepts by applying them to the two-level minimum weight8	 ORIGINAL RAGE IS
OF POOR QUALITY
design of a portal framework under local constraints on
stresses and local buckling and global constraints on
displacement. At the global level, the weight of the
framework is minimized with respect to the cross-sectional
area and bending moment of inertia of the different beams,
while satisfying constraints on displacements. Once a
global design is obtained, the framework is analyzed to
obtain the end loads on the beams. At the local level, each
beam is designed separately. Its detailed dimensions are
proportioned so as achieve the values of cross-sectional
area and bending moment of inertia chosen at the global
level while satisfying constraints on stresses and local
buckling. 	This is done by minimizing a measure of the
violation of the subproblem constraints. An optimum
sensitivity analysis (Ref. 22) is then performed in order to
obtain a linear approximation to the constraint violation of
each local level subproblem in terms of the global level
variables. The whole optimization is repeated, but, at the
global level, it is required that the (linearized) local
level constraint violations be reduced. This iterative
process is pursued until all the local and global level
constraints are satisfied and the framework weight cannot be
reduced further. Although the proposed scheme is applied to
a structural synthesis problem, it is applicable to any typeOt;i 	 L	r,	
9
OF POOP QUALITY
of engineering design. Furthermore, it may be used with
decompositions involving more than two levels. Some of the
key features of the approach are discussed below.
The method postulates a multilevel decomposition of the
problem, that is, a decomposition where the different
subproblems are grouped on the levels of a hierarchy. The
subproblem at the top level is concerned with the
optimization of the overall system objective in terms of
design variables describing that system in very global
terms. As one proceeds down the hierarchy, the subproblems
are dealing wi~h subsystems described in deeper and deeper
levels of detail. The choice of the specifics of the
decomposition for a given application still remains largely
a matter of physical insight and convenience.
Below the highest level, each subproblem is concerned
with finding a set of design variables which satisfy its own
constraints for fixed values of higher level variables. It
turns out that this amounts to finding a design vector which
satisfies a set of equality constraints and a set of
inequality constraints. Such a mathematical problem may not
have a solution. It may be transformed into a mathematical
programming problem which maximizes a measure of "how well"
the design satisfies the sets of constraints. The
subproblem formulation of Ref. 21 uses the equality10
ORIGINAL PAGE 19
OF POOR QUALITY
constraints to eliminate dependent variables and forms a
penalty function with the inequality constraints. That
penalty function is a measure of constraint violation which
is then minimized with respect to the independent variables
to find that design which best meets the constraints.
Once designs are obtained for all the subproblems on a
given level, sensitivity analyses are performed to determine
the effect changes in higher level variables have on lower
level constraint violations. The resulting sensitivity
derivatives are used to construct linear approximations to
the lower subproblem constraint violations in terms of the
higher level design variables. 	These approximations are
added as constraints for the next optimization of the higher
level subproblems. This enables the optimization of the
higher level subproblems to be conducted so as to improve
the design of the lower level subproblems which have
violated constraints or so as to reduce the margin of
satisfaction for those subproblems for which all constraints
are amply satisfied. In essence, this makes the trade-offs
between the different subproblems visible and allows them to
be resolved in a rational fashion.
The task of the highest level subproblem remains the
optimization of the system performance index with respect to
its own global variables which are required not only toI= POOR QUALITY
satisfy its own constraints but also to reduce the
constraint violation for the lower level subproblems.
1.2	OUTLINE
The purpose of this work has been to investigate the
applicability of Sobieski's method to the design of complex,
multidisciplinary engineering systems. It was elected to
focus the effort on a specific example: the simultaneous
aerodynamic and structural design of a high-performance
sailplane wing for maximum cross-country speed. 	It was
determined that this design problem could be carried out by
means of a four-level decomposition. An algorithm was
developed to solve the problem and it was tested on the two
lower levels of the decomposition.
In Chapter II, we discuss the optimum sensitivity
analysis technique. We show that the stationary conditions
satisfied at a local constrained optimum may be used to
determine the sensitivity of optimum objective functions and
design variables to changes in those parameters that were
kept fixed during the optimization.
Chapter III is devoted to a detailed description of the
proposed algorithm. It is constructed along the same lines
as that described in Ref. 20. The main difference resides
with the specifics of the mathematical formulation for the12
OF pOOR QUALITY
individual subproblems. The present algorithm treats
equality constraints in a general numerical fashion.
Furthermore, it is designed as a constrained programming
problem rather than as a penalty function minimization
problem. Particular attention is paid to the potential
difficulties associated with decompositions that involve
more than two levels.
In Chapter IV, the decomposition proposed for the example
problem is detailed. It is a four-level decomposition. The
highest level subproblem entails selection of global
performance parameters which include weight and aerodynamic
characteristics. Then follows an aerodynamic subproblem
where the shape of the wing is defined so as to obtain the
aerodynamic characteristics specified in the performance
subproblem and control the initiation bf stall. On the
third level of the decomposition is a global structural
subproblem where the wing -spanwise distributions of weight
and stiffnesses are selected for fixed total weight and so
as to limit the wing bending response and torsional
divergence speed. Finally, at the lowest level, the wing is
modeled by a series of spanwise elements each of which is
designed separately for fixed weight and stiffnesses under
stress and local buckling constraints.
sl13
In Chapter V, the algorithm introduced in Chap. III is
applied to the two lower levels of the hierarchy described
in Chap. IV. The problem solved is the minimum weight
design of a straight composite wing. Results are given for
designs started from both the feasible space and the
infeasible space.
Finally, Chapter VI is devoted to synthesizing the
experience gained with this work and making recommendations
for continued investigation.OF POOR QJHLi d V

SUMMARY OF PERTINENT RESULTS FROM OPTIMUM
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Optimum sensitivity analysis is a technique which permits
one to investigate the sensitivity of the solution of an
optimization problem to variations in the parameters of the
problem. It yields derivatives of the optimum values of the
design variables and objective function with respect to the
parameters, derivatives which may then be used to perform
trade-off analyses. These derivatives are called
sensitivity derivatives to distinguish them from the
derivatives of objective function and constraints with
respect to the design variables which are termed behavior
derivatives. 	This technique was recently introduced by
Sobieski and coauthors (Ref. 22) as a tool for structural
synthesis. It has been specialized by Schmit and Chang
(Ref. 23) to a formulation of the problem of structural
sizing for mimimum weight based on approximation concepts
and dual methods, and has been used by Haftka (Ref.  24 ) in
the optimization of damage tolerant structures. The
elements of the technique required for the remainder of this
work are discussed in this chapter; the reader interested in
a more general discussion should consult Ref. 22.

In	these	equations, 	subscript 	x	indicates 	partial
derivatives with respect to the design variables;
superscript a refers to the constraints exactly satisfied
(active) at the local minimum (there are m a such constraints
and g  is a subvector of g); finally, X is the vector of
Lagrange multipliers (dual variables). The object of
optimum sensitivity analysis is to find the rates of change
of F and X with respect to P. We define these rates of
changes as follows
X' = dX	(matrix, nxk components)

F' = dF	(vector, k components) 	 (2.4)

If F'	and X'	are known, 	we may construct linear
approximations to the solution of Problem (2.1),
F*(P+AP) = F*(P)+F'TAP
X*(P+AP) = X *(P)+X'TAP	(2.5)
The two following sections are devoted to calculating F' and
X'.
2.2	SENSITIVITY DERIVATIVES OF THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
The optimum sensitivity derivative of the objective function
is obtained by the chain rule of differentiation as
F' = FP+X' TFx	(2.6)OF POOR QUALITY
where subscript p indicates partial derivatives with respect
to vector P. Now, we can show that F' may be found without
actually calculating X'. We require that the optimum point
for P+AP remain at the intersection of the constraints
determining the optimum point for P. Hence, the second of
Eqs. 2.3 is stationary with respect to P,
,_(,a*) = gp*+ga*X' = 0	(2.7)
*Combining Eq. 2.7 transposed and postmultiplied by a and
the first of Eqs. 2.3 premultiplied by X' T, we obtain
X'TFx = 9a*T a*	 (2.8)
or
F' = Fp+,a*T a *	(2.9)
*The Lagrange multipliers a may be available as by-products
of the optimization scheme; otherwise, they may be obtained
by QR decomposition or from the more classical least-squares
solution to the first of Eqs. 2.3,
19a*9a*T F 
1ga*Fx
Then, Eq. 2.9 yields F' directly. 	An alternate solution
exists because Eq. 2.7 is the only condition that X' must18	AV PP.Gr ts

meet in order for Eq. 2.8 to be satisfied. 	Therefore, if
for some matrix Y (nxk)
ga*+ga*Y = 0	 (2.11)p x
then
X'TF = ga*Ta* = YTF x	p	x
and
F' = Fp+YTFx	(2.12)
Equation 2.11 represents k sets of m a linear equations in n
unknowns, with m a <_ n. We may therefore give arbitrary
values to n-m a components of each column of Y and deduce the
remaining m a components from Eq. 2.11. In general, Y
differs from the true sensitivity derivatives of the
variables X' , unless n = m a. Assume that, in the space of
the design variables X, an infinitesimal perturbation of
parameter P results in a move from the initial point in the
direction specified by Y. Then, the resulting design is

The approach of Sec. 2.2 yields the exact value of F' at
considerably lower cost than that of Sec. 2.3 since it
involves only first-order partial derivatives of F and q 
with respect to the design variables and parameters of the
problem. However, it does not usually permit one to obtain
X' (unless n = m a). The choice between the two types of
analysis is very much dependent on the application
considered and the nature of the optimization problem at
hand. It must be guided by a comparison between the cost of
calculating second-order partial derivatives of F and g  on
the one hand, and the benefit of knowing the sensitivity
derivatives of the variables on the other hand.
It must be noted that higher order sensitivity
derivatives may be obtained for X F and X by setting
higher order total derivatives of the two first stationary
conditions (Eqs. 2.3) to zero. In particular, Ref. 25 shows
how little additional calculation is required to find F",
once X' has been obtained.
2.4	ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
After solving a mathematical programming problem and
before performing sensitivity analysis, it is necessary to
find the set of the active constraints. These constraints
must satisfy Eqs. 2.3; furthermore, their gradients must be21QF:i zrr',AL! el-- y N:^

linearly independent, if one wants to obtain the Lagrange
multipliers from Eq. 2.10. The algorithm described below
was used with success.
i)Select an initial set S  of nearly satisfied
constraints by retaining those constraints whose
value is above a small negative tolerance.
ii)Identify S pa, the subset of S a which contains the
maximum number of constraints with independent
gradients. To achieve that, the constraint
gradients are taken as the columns of a rectangular
matrix and a Gaussian elimination with row and
column interchanges is performed to identify the
independent columns.
iii)Use Eq. 2.10 to find the Lagrange multipliers
corresponding to set S pa. Note that the fact that
the constraints of set Spa have independent
gradients is a guarantee that Eq. 2.10 has a
solution.
iv)Find the smallest Lagrange multiplier ai.
V)	If X. is negative (less than a small positive
tolerance), eliminate constraint i from set S  and
restart the process in ii). 	If X  is positive,
terminate the process since S'a is the desired set.22	'3F ? DR U` F_:
Note that steps ii) and iii) would not be required if QR
decomposition were used. In step v), only the constraints
with strictly positive Lagrange multipliers are kept, even
though active constraints may have Lagrange multipliers that
are zero. This is because constraints with zero Lagrange
multipliers are redundant; hence, their gradients are
linearly dependent on other constraint gradients.
In this work, the sensitivity derivatives are used to
extend optimization information over a range of variation
for the parameters of the design problems considered. This
is achieved by means of the linear extrapolations given in
Eq. 2.5. The implicit relationships 2.2 are expected to be
nonlinear, in general. Hence, the extrapolations being
first-order Taylor series expansions, they are valid only
for limited AP. Furthermore, the calculation of the
sensitivity derivatives is based on the assumption that the
set of constraints active at the initial optimum will remain
unchanged as the parameter P is changed to P+AP.
Perturbations of the parameters cause moves of the
constraint boundaries with respect to each other and,
therefore, may very well result in changes in the active
constraint set. These changes then imply reduced accuracy
of the extrapolated optima. The question arises of whether
it is possible to estimate the magnitude of the parameterOF POOR QvA° ITY
perturbations which cause changes in the active constraint
set. It was proposed in Ref. 22 that the perturbation of
parameter p (element of vector P) which results in
constraint i changing from active status to inactive status
may be obtained to the first order by stating that X  is
reduced to zero when constraint i leaves the active set,
Xi(P+APi) _ Xi(P)+Xi(P)APi = 0
or
Opi = -ai(P)/Xi(P)	(2.15)
Reference 22 likewise suggested that the perturbation of
parameter p causing constraint i to change from inactive
status to active status could be found as that value ep i for
which gi(p+Api) becomes zero.
gi(P+APi) = gi(P)+1gix(P)X'(P)1APi = 0
then
APi= -gi(P)/Igix( P)X'(P))	(2.16)
It was observed in Ref. 26 that Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 could be
unreliable. These estimates were used to determine with a
specific design problem example what parameter perturbations
cause changes in the status of the different constraints247^ "n
OF POOR QJAUTY
involved, attempting so to speak, to construct an history
of the active constraint set as p varies. This may not be
an appropriate approach. Indeed, Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 may be
used to estimate a Ap i for each of the problem constraints,
indicating when the status of a particular constraint is
supposed to change. However, only the smallest (in absolute
value) negative and positive of these dp i (Ap_ and 4p+)
should be taken into consideration. The extrapolations
based on sensitivity derivatives obtained at p should be
adequate for p+Ap - < p+pp 5 p+pp +, But any prediction
beyond that range (in particular prediction of change in the
active constraint set) should not be relied upon since it
would have been obtained with derivatives corresponding to
an inappropriate active constraint set. In essence, as
suggested in Ref. 23, the Ap i of Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 must be
regarded as bounds on Op. Barring excessive nonlinearity,
the range of ep defined by the intersection of these bounds
is that within which the extrapolations based on sensitivity
derivatives calculated at p should be reliable. 	In the
absence of changes in the active constraint set, the
accuracy of Eq. 	2.5 is limited only by the inherent
nonlinearity of the specific design problem considered.
Experiments conducted with various structural design
problems showed (Ref. 22) that linear-extrapolation-based25
N
estimates of optimum objective functions and design
variables fell within a few percent of actual optimization
result, for parameter variations of up to twenty percent;
the predictions often were better for the objective function
than for the design variables.(n^ niece,.

PRESENTATION OF THE ALGORITHM
This chapter is devoted to discussing an algorithm proposed
for the design of complex engineering systems. The method
is based on multilevel decomposition of the corresponding
design problems 	into	subproblems 	which	are	solved
separately. 	The algorithm is discussed in general terms.
This is done so as to avoid focusing on a particular
problem. 	The following chapter will be devoted to
investigating the applicability of the approach described
here to a specific problem. 	The abstract concepts
introduced here can be more easily put in a physical context
if this chapter and the following one are read
simultaneously. The presentation begins with a definition
of the type of multilevel decomposition considered and of
the components of that decomposition. Then, the discussion
centers on the formulation and solution of the subproblems.
Finally, the organization of the overall optimization is
discussed. 	The developments follow those by Sobieski in
Ref. 20.

3.1	DEFINITIONS
The starting point of this discussion is the task of
designing a system by finding a set of variables which
optimize a performance index while satisfying a number of
constraints. This will be referred to as the
overall problem. Assume that, for convenience, the overall
problem is decomposed into a number of subproblems, each of
which corresponds to the design of a subsystem, and has its
own sets of variables and constraints. The subproblems are
organized in a hierarchy as shown on Fig. 1. The subproblem
at the top of the hierarchy is the design of the whole
system, in very general terms. The next level deals with
major subsystems, the third one with subsystems of the major
subsystems, and so on. As one goes down the levels, the
details of the system become more and more precisely
defined. The subproblems are identified by two numbers ij
which define (i) the level of the subproblem, and (j) its
position on that level. 	The level numbers increase
downward, and the subproblem numbers increase, say, from
left to right. The hierarchy is assumed to have 1 levels,
there are n  subproblems on level i.
The whole design process is conducted iteratively,
starting at the highest level and going down. 	Each
subsystem is designed separately. 	The object of the
algorithm is to coordinate the design of the different28

subsystems so as to obtain optimum system performance by
resolving the trade-offs between the subsystems in a
rational fashion. This is achieved by manipulating two
types of interactions between the subproblems: the controls
and the responses. A control is a quantity selected in a
subproblem to influence another subproblem in the hierarchy.
A response is a quantity that reflects the effect the design
of one subproblem has on that of another subproblem. In
this work, we assume that the controls flow exclusively
downward in the hierarchy, while the responses flow
exclusively upward. This excludes situations where a
subproblem controls another subproblem on the same level
(lateral control) or on a higher level (reverse control).'
As represented symbolically on Fig. 2, each subproblem is
assumed to receive controls from higher level subproblems
through vector CI ij (control inputs in subproblem if), and
to receive responses from lower level subproblems through
vector RIij (response inputs in subproblem i1). Also, each
subproblem is assumed to control lower level subproblems
with vector COij (control outputs from subproblem i^), and
' In Ref. 20, the controls are named interaction quantities.
The interested reader should refer to that source for
indications as to how to handle reverse and lateral
controls.c) Highest level subproblem.

to respond to higher level subproblems with vector ROij
(response outputs from subproblem ice). This discussion does
not make any assumption on the specific form of the
controls, except that the control outputs from a subproblem
depend on the variables of that subproblem; they may be the
variables themselves or functions of these variables (CO .j =i
Coij(Xij)). Likewise, the controls imposed on subproblem ij
(CI ij) are not specified , except that they are assumed
known once all the control outputs from higher level
subproblems (Co ri, a<i) are known. The response outputs
from a subproblem (RO ij) will be defined in this chapter.
Furthermore, it will be shown that the response inputs into
a subproblem (RI ij) are entirely known once the response
outputs from the lower level subproblems (RO as, a>i) are
known.
For each iteration of the overall system, each subproblem
is concerned with finding a design which satisfies its own
constraints for the controls specified by the higher level
subproblems (CI ij). In addition, the subproblem manipulates
its own controls (CO..) so as to improve the responses from
the lower level subproblems (RI ij ).	Mathematically, this
implies finding a design vector that satisfies a set of0"KY A p P cn- n
32	OF POOR QUALITY
equality constraints and a set of inequality constraints.
This problem may be solved by transforming it into a
nonlinear mathematical programming problem where a measure
of constraint violation is minimized with respect to the
design vector. The subproblem's own response (RO ij) is then
constituted of the minimum measure of constraint violation
as well as derivatives indicating the sensitivity of that
minimum measure to changes in the controls imposed on the
subproblem.
The subproblem on the highest level of the hierarchy
drives the whole design process. It selects its own design
variables so as to optimize the overall problem performance
index and satisfy its own constraints. It adjusts its
controls (CO 11) to improve the responses from the lower
levels (RI 11), that is, reduce the constraint violation in
the lower level subproblems.
3.2 	 LOWEST LEVEL SUBPROBLEM
Figure 2 a) describes symbolically subproblem lj, a
subproblem on the lowest level of the hierarchy. The vector
of design variables is X lj, the subproblem design is
influenced by the controls collected in vector CI lj and the
subproblem response is vector RO lj.	The subproblem

The functions g lj and elj are vector-valued. The subproblem
design is subject to a set of inequality constraints (Eq.
3.1.a). These are the constraints set on the corresponding
subsystem in the statement of the overall non-decomposed
problem. The design is also subject to a set of equality
constraints (Eq. 3.1.b). Some of these may come from the
formulation of the overall non-decomposed problem; some are
imposed on the subproblem during decomposition. The
multilevel decomposition consists of different models of the
system being designed, the models becoming more refined as
one progresses down the hierarchy. The equality constraints
arise from the necessity of requiring consistency between
the models at different levels. Also, some upper and lower
bounds may be set on the variables (Eq. 3.1.c). As stated
in the previous section, the subproblem is assumed to be
controlled by each subproblem on the higher levels. As a
result, the vector of controls CI lj is functionally
dependent on the optimum designs of all the subproblems
above the lowest level.34

where b is a positive constant. Each equality constraint is
replaced by two inequality constraints (Eq. 3.3.c). The
distance between these constraints (2n ij ) is forced to
remain positive because of Eq. 3.3.e and to decrease because
of the second term in the objective function. 	Each
inequality constraint is relaxed by the addition of variable
E: mechanism of that relaxation is described in Fig.
3, for a simple two-dimensional problem with one equality
and three inequality constraints, assuming that the equality
constraint is identically satisfied. The first term in the
objective function (Eq. 3.3.a) is defined so as to increase
Eli . A high positive value for Eli is quite acceptable as
it means that the selected design point is deep inside the
feasible domain, away from the constraint boundaries, and
that decreases the chances of obtaining infeasible designs
when the controls are perturbed. If the solution of Problem
3.3 is so that Eli z 0 and Ti lj = 0, then it solves Problem
3.1. If, on the other hand, we have Elj < 0 or Ti lj x 0,
then the resulting design is infeasible with respect to
Problem 3.1.
Constant b is added to the definition of the objective
function to control the importance attributed to violatingOF POOP: QJA i"d Y
the different constraints. A high value for b results in a
heavy penalty paid for violating equality constraints;
conversely, a low value for b makes the penalty for
violating inequality constraints more important, in relative
terms. In addition to adjusting b, it may prove appropriate
to scale variables E1j and n1j in order to make all
components of the constraint gradients of the same order of
magnitude.
Any nonlinear programming algorithm may be used to solve
Problem 3.3. 	This yields X lj, as well as a measure of
inequality constraint violation E1j and a measure of
equality constraint violation n1j. These are functionally
dependent on the controls CI 1j and, therefore, as indicated
by Eq. 3.2, on the optimum design variables of subproblems
on higher levels. Optimum sensitivity analysis may be used
to study the effect changes in higher level subproblem
variables have on the constraint violations for subproblem
lj.	Considering £1j, if all higher level subproblem

DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTILEVEL OPTIMIZATION APPROACH TO THE DESIGN
OF MODERN ENGINEERING SYSTEMS
by
Jean-Francois Marie Barthelemy
(ABSTRACT)
This work describes an optimization approach to the design
of complex engineering systems. The approach assumes a
decomposition of the original problem (design of the system)
into smaller subproblems (design of subsystems) organized in
a multilevel hierarchy. As one goes down the levels, the
details of the system become more precisely defined;
furthermore, each subproblem may control the design of lower
level subproblems.
A general algorithm is proposed which carries out the
design process iteratively, starting at the top of the
hierarchy and proceeding downward. Each subproblem is
optimized separately for fixed controls from higher level
subproblems. 	An optimum sensitivity analysis is then
performed which determines the sensitivity of the subproblem
i0R1 GINAL PACE 13
OF POOR QUALITY
design to changes in higher level subproblem controls. The
resulting sensitivity derivatives are used to construct
constraints which force the controlling subproblems into
chosing their own designs so as to improve the lower level
subproblem designs while satisfying their own constraints.
The applicability of the proposed algorithm is
demonstrated by devising a four-level hierarchy to perform
the simultaneous aerodynamic and structural design_ of a
high-performance sailplane wing for maximum cross-country
speed.	The levels are devoted successively to selecting
global	performance parameters, 	determining 	the wing
aerodynamic shape, defining the spanwise distributions of
global structural characteristics, 	and, performing the
detailed design of wing substructures.
Finally, the concepts discussed are applied to the two-
level minimum weight structural design of the sailplane
wing. The numerical experiments show that discontinuities
in the sensitivity derivatives may delay convergence, but
that the algorithm is robust enough to overcome these
discontinuities and produce low-weight feasible designs,
regardless of whether the optimization is started from the
feasible space or the infeasible one.

INTRODUCTION
The design of modern engineering systems is a procedure
which often integrates different disciplines and always
involves a large number of variables. While optimization
techniques provide an attractive formal tool for carrying
out the design process, a weakness of these techniques
remains in their inability to handle 	truly large
multidisciplinary design problems. 	To overcome that
weakness, designers must resort to some sort of
decomposition method. The original design problem is broken
down into smaller subproblems which are then optimized
separately. However, these subproblems are generally
coupled so that an iterative scheme must be devised which
coordinates their optimization in order that the resulting
design is, to some extent, optimum with respect to the
original problem.
1.1	OVERVIEW OF EXISTING LITERATURE
Several studies have been devoted to decomposition of large
optimization problems. These studies pertain to all the
areas of engineering as well as economics and management.
The following overview focuses mainly on structuralOF POOR 	 eW
optimization. For the sake of the discussion, two classes
of decomposition methods are defined: formal methods and
intuitive methods. In formal methods, the mathematical
structure of the problem is exploited to arrive at a rigid
decomposition scheme. Consequently, a rigorous framework
exists within which the mathematical properties of the
method may be assessed. In intuitive methods, understanding
of the behavior of the physical system considered is
apparently the prime factor directing the decomposition.
These methods are sometimes referred to as rational methods
and their mathematical characteristics can seldom be studied
in great detail. An intuitive approach provides, of course,
the only option for decomposing those problems which do not
possess the structure for which a formal decomposition
method exists. This division into formal and intuitive
methods is somewhat arbitrary as a given approach may very
well be shown to belong to both classes; however,it
facilitates the discussion.
1.1.1	Formal Decomposition Methods
A very extensive body of work exists on decomposition in
linear programming (LP). The existence of truly large
problems in the fields of economics and operations research
has stimulated efforts aiming at exploiting the specialOF, POOR ft:{rv^ a ^}^^
structures of the constraint matrix. The major initial step
in that area seems to have been the introduction of the
Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle in 1960. By 1970 the
developments in this active field were so numerous as to
warrant the publication of a textbook by Lasdon (Ref. 1).
In the area of structural design, problems involving
collapse design of trusses and frames were solved
successfully using the LP decomposition techniques (Refs.
2-5).
Dynamic programming (DP) was discussed by Bellman as
early as 1957 (Ref. 6). 	It is a decomposition method
suitable for nonlinear problems. The problems must be
serial, that is, of the form such that any change in the
design of one subproblem affects only those subproblems that
are	"downstream" 	in	the	decision-making 	process.
Furthermore, the problem objective function must be
additive. However, DP cannot easily handle constraints that
involve more than one subproblem. Also, it becomes very
expensive if there are large amounts of data transmitted
between successive subproblems. Among the advantages of the
DP method are its capability to generate global optimum
designs and to handle discrete variables and discontinuous
functions. In structural design, dynamic programming seems
to find use in optimization of "one-dimensional" structures,OF POOR QU ? €TV
N
that is, beams, one-bay multistory or one-story multibay
frames, and transmission towers (see Ref. 7 Chap. XI or Ref.
8).
Optimization algorithms were devised for separable
nonlinear problems using coordination techniques developed
in the context of multilevel decision-making processes.
Once a problem has been decomposed into smaller subproblems,
the main task is to coordinate the design of the different
subproblems. Essentially, the subproblems are grouped on
the lower level of a hierarchy and an additional higher
level subproblem is added whose role is to select the values
of coordinating variables so as to force the other
subproblems into choosing designs corresponding to improved
overall problem performance. The coordinating subproblem is
itself cast in the form of an optimization problem. As the
evaluation of the objective function of the coordinating
subproblem requires complete optimization of all lower level
subproblems, this type of algorithm may turn out to be very
expensive. A study of coordination in hierarchical systems
is given in the 1970 monograph by Mesarovic and coauthors
(Ref. 9). Kirsch and coworkers have used both the model
coordination technique and the goal coordination technique
to solve various structural design problems (Ref. 7 Chap. X
and Refs. 10-12)1.1.2	Intuitive Decomposition Methods
The first attempts at developing intuitive decomposition
schemes for large structural design problems were extensions
of the fully stressed design method. In these approaches
the structure is seen as a combination of elements
(substructures). 	Given an initial design for all the
elements, an analysis of the structure is made to determine
inter-element forces. 	Then, each element is optimized
separately on the assumption that changes in that element
design do not change inter-element forces. Once all the
elements have ,been designed, the structure is analyzed again
and the process repeated until convergence is achieved.
Giles (Ref. 13) and Sobieski (Ref. 14) performed the design
of airplane wings under constraints on stresses and element
stability using that approach. Kirsch and coworkers (Ref.
15) designed frameworks using a similar approach but
reanalyzing 	the	structure 	after	each	substructure
optimization, 	in order to account better for load
redistribution.
When optimizing a structure one substructure at a time,
it is difficult to handle global constraints, that is, those
constraints affected by variables belonging to more than one
substructure. In Ref. 16, Sobieski and Loendorf designed
airplane fuselages under local constraints on stresses and6
OF P'^JCR
local instabilities and global constraints on fuselage
elastic displacements. The optimization was first carried
out with the local constraints, as described above. If
necessary, the resulting design was subsequently modified to
satisfy the displacement constraints using a unit load
method to determine the impact that changes in element
design have on the violated displacements. Another example
of treatment of global constraints is given by Hughes and
coworkers (Ref. 17) who designed ship compartments for
minimum cost under constraints on stresses.
A generalized fully stressed design approach to large
problems is certainly economically appealing. However, it
presents two difficulties. As pointed out in Ref. 14
"...minimization of the individual component masses does not
guarantee minimization of the total mass This situation
is caused by the inability to control the load path on the
assembled structure level... ." As mentioned earlier also,
it makes it difficult to handle global constraints. 	In
Refs. 18 and 19 Schmit and coworkers used a two-level
approach to design trusses and aircraft wings. At the
global level, the distributions of stiffnesses, the global
level variables, were chosen so as to minimize the total
structural weight, while satisfying global displacement
constraints and also some local constraints on stresses andORIGINA L PAGE @S 	7
OF POOR QUALITY
structural element buckling. For known stiffnesses, the end
forces on the various structural elements were calculated.
At the local level, these structural elements were optimized
separately with respect to their detail design, the local
level variables, so that the changes in element stiffnesses
were minimized, while the local constraints were still
satisfied. The process was repeated until convergence was
achieved. In this decomposition, the introduction of the
global level problem was a key factor in overcoming both
difficulties . attributed to the generalized fully stressed
design approach. By placing the minimization of the weight
at the global level, the opportunity was kept to trade
structural mass between the elements in order to improve the
load paths while reducing the total weight. 	Also, the
provision was left to explicitly handle global constraints.
1.1.3	General Approach to Engineering System Design
The intuitive decomposition methods discussed to this point
are very specific and cannot easily be extended to different
classes of problems. In particular, they are not suited for
multidisciplinary problems. In Ref. 20, Sobieski proposed a
general approach to the design of large engineering systems,
and in Ref. 21, he proceeded to demonstrate the proposed
concepts by applying them to the two-level minimum weight8	 ORIGINAL RAGE IS
OF POOR QUALITY
design of a portal framework under local constraints on
stresses and local buckling and global constraints on
displacement. At the global level, the weight of the
framework is minimized with respect to the cross-sectional
area and bending moment of inertia of the different beams,
while satisfying constraints on displacements. Once a
global design is obtained, the framework is analyzed to
obtain the end loads on the beams. At the local level, each
beam is designed separately. Its detailed dimensions are
proportioned so as achieve the values of cross-sectional
area and bending moment of inertia chosen at the global
level while satisfying constraints on stresses and local
buckling. 	This is done by minimizing a measure of the
violation of the subproblem constraints. An optimum
sensitivity analysis (Ref. 22) is then performed in order to
obtain a linear approximation to the constraint violation of
each local level subproblem in terms of the global level
variables. The whole optimization is repeated, but, at the
global level, it is required that the (linearized) local
level constraint violations be reduced. This iterative
process is pursued until all the local and global level
constraints are satisfied and the framework weight cannot be
reduced further. Although the proposed scheme is applied to
a structural synthesis problem, it is applicable to any typeOt;i 	 L	r,	
9
OF POOP QUALITY
of engineering design. Furthermore, it may be used with
decompositions involving more than two levels. Some of the
key features of the approach are discussed below.
The method postulates a multilevel decomposition of the
problem, that is, a decomposition where the different
subproblems are grouped on the levels of a hierarchy. The
subproblem at the top level is concerned with the
optimization of the overall system objective in terms of
design variables describing that system in very global
terms. As one proceeds down the hierarchy, the subproblems
are dealing wi~h subsystems described in deeper and deeper
levels of detail. The choice of the specifics of the
decomposition for a given application still remains largely
a matter of physical insight and convenience.
Below the highest level, each subproblem is concerned
with finding a set of design variables which satisfy its own
constraints for fixed values of higher level variables. It
turns out that this amounts to finding a design vector which
satisfies a set of equality constraints and a set of
inequality constraints. Such a mathematical problem may not
have a solution. It may be transformed into a mathematical
programming problem which maximizes a measure of "how well"
the design satisfies the sets of constraints. The
subproblem formulation of Ref. 21 uses the equality10
ORIGINAL PAGE 19
OF POOR QUALITY
constraints to eliminate dependent variables and forms a
penalty function with the inequality constraints. That
penalty function is a measure of constraint violation which
is then minimized with respect to the independent variables
to find that design which best meets the constraints.
Once designs are obtained for all the subproblems on a
given level, sensitivity analyses are performed to determine
the effect changes in higher level variables have on lower
level constraint violations. The resulting sensitivity
derivatives are used to construct linear approximations to
the lower subproblem constraint violations in terms of the
higher level design variables. 	These approximations are
added as constraints for the next optimization of the higher
level subproblems. This enables the optimization of the
higher level subproblems to be conducted so as to improve
the design of the lower level subproblems which have
violated constraints or so as to reduce the margin of
satisfaction for those subproblems for which all constraints
are amply satisfied. In essence, this makes the trade-offs
between the different subproblems visible and allows them to
be resolved in a rational fashion.
The task of the highest level subproblem remains the
optimization of the system performance index with respect to
its own global variables which are required not only toI= POOR QUALITY
satisfy its own constraints but also to reduce the
constraint violation for the lower level subproblems.
1.2	OUTLINE
The purpose of this work has been to investigate the
applicability of Sobieski's method to the design of complex,
multidisciplinary engineering systems. It was elected to
focus the effort on a specific example: the simultaneous
aerodynamic and structural design of a high-performance
sailplane wing for maximum cross-country speed. 	It was
determined that this design problem could be carried out by
means of a four-level decomposition. An algorithm was
developed to solve the problem and it was tested on the two
lower levels of the decomposition.
In Chapter II, we discuss the optimum sensitivity
analysis technique. We show that the stationary conditions
satisfied at a local constrained optimum may be used to
determine the sensitivity of optimum objective functions and
design variables to changes in those parameters that were
kept fixed during the optimization.
Chapter III is devoted to a detailed description of the
proposed algorithm. It is constructed along the same lines
as that described in Ref. 20. The main difference resides
with the specifics of the mathematical formulation for the12
OF pOOR QUALITY
individual subproblems. The present algorithm treats
equality constraints in a general numerical fashion.
Furthermore, it is designed as a constrained programming
problem rather than as a penalty function minimization
problem. Particular attention is paid to the potential
difficulties associated with decompositions that involve
more than two levels.
In Chapter IV, the decomposition proposed for the example
problem is detailed. It is a four-level decomposition. The
highest level subproblem entails selection of global
performance parameters which include weight and aerodynamic
characteristics. Then follows an aerodynamic subproblem
where the shape of the wing is defined so as to obtain the
aerodynamic characteristics specified in the performance
subproblem and control the initiation bf stall. On the
third level of the decomposition is a global structural
subproblem where the wing -spanwise distributions of weight
and stiffnesses are selected for fixed total weight and so
as to limit the wing bending response and torsional
divergence speed. Finally, at the lowest level, the wing is
modeled by a series of spanwise elements each of which is
designed separately for fixed weight and stiffnesses under
stress and local buckling constraints.
sl13
In Chapter V, the algorithm introduced in Chap. III is
applied to the two lower levels of the hierarchy described
in Chap. IV. The problem solved is the minimum weight
design of a straight composite wing. Results are given for
designs started from both the feasible space and the
infeasible space.
Finally, Chapter VI is devoted to synthesizing the
experience gained with this work and making recommendations
for continued investigation.OF POOR QJHLi d V

SUMMARY OF PERTINENT RESULTS FROM OPTIMUM
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Optimum sensitivity analysis is a technique which permits
one to investigate the sensitivity of the solution of an
optimization problem to variations in the parameters of the
problem. It yields derivatives of the optimum values of the
design variables and objective function with respect to the
parameters, derivatives which may then be used to perform
trade-off analyses. These derivatives are called
sensitivity derivatives to distinguish them from the
derivatives of objective function and constraints with
respect to the design variables which are termed behavior
derivatives. 	This technique was recently introduced by
Sobieski and coauthors (Ref. 22) as a tool for structural
synthesis. It has been specialized by Schmit and Chang
(Ref. 23) to a formulation of the problem of structural
sizing for mimimum weight based on approximation concepts
and dual methods, and has been used by Haftka (Ref.  24 ) in
the optimization of damage tolerant structures. The
elements of the technique required for the remainder of this
work are discussed in this chapter; the reader interested in
a more general discussion should consult Ref. 22.

superscript a refers to the constraints exactly satisfied

Lagrange multipliers (dual variables). The object of
optimum sensitivity analysis is to find the rates of change
of F and X with respect to P. We define these rates of
changes as follows

The two following sections are devoted to calculating F' and
X'.
2.2	SENSITIVITY DERIVATIVES OF THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
The optimum sensitivity derivative of the objective function
is obtained by the chain rule of differentiation as
F' = FP+X' TFx	(2.6)OF POOR QUALITY
where subscript p indicates partial derivatives with respect
to vector P. Now, we can show that F' may be found without
actually calculating X'. We require that the optimum point
for P+AP remain at the intersection of the constraints
determining the optimum point for P. Hence, the second of
Eqs. 2.3 is stationary with respect to P,
,_(,a*) = gp*+ga*X' = 0	(2.7)
*Combining Eq. 2.7 transposed and postmultiplied by a and
the first of Eqs. 2.3 premultiplied by X' T, we obtain
X'TFx = 9a*T a*	 (2.8)
or
F' = Fp+,a*T a *	(2.9)
*The Lagrange multipliers a may be available as by-products
of the optimization scheme; otherwise, they may be obtained
by QR decomposition or from the more classical least-squares
solution to the first of Eqs. 2.3,

Then, Eq. 2.9 yields F' directly. 	An alternate solution
exists because Eq. 2.7 is the only condition that X' must18	AV PP.Gr ts

meet in order for Eq. 2.8 to be satisfied. 	Therefore, if
for some matrix Y (nxk)
ga*+ga*Y = 0	 (2.11)p x
then
X'TF = ga*Ta* = YTF x	p	x
and
F' = Fp+YTFx	(2.12)
Equation 2.11 represents k sets of m a linear equations in n
unknowns, with m a <_ n. We may therefore give arbitrary
values to n-m a components of each column of Y and deduce the
remaining m a components from Eq. 2.11. In general, Y
differs from the true sensitivity derivatives of the
variables X' , unless n = m a. Assume that, in the space of
the design variables X, an infinitesimal perturbation of
parameter P results in a move from the initial point in the
direction specified by Y. Then, the resulting design is
still at the intersection of the originally active
constraints because condition 2.7 is enforced; however, it
may not be optimum because the first of Eqs. 2.3 may not be
satisfied any more.

The approach of Sec. 2.2 yields the exact value of F' at
considerably lower cost than that of Sec. 2.3 since it
involves only first-order partial derivatives of F and q 
with respect to the design variables and parameters of the
problem. However, it does not usually permit one to obtain
X' (unless n = m a). The choice between the two types of
analysis is very much dependent on the application
considered and the nature of the optimization problem at
hand. It must be guided by a comparison between the cost of
calculating second-order partial derivatives of F and g  on
the one hand, and the benefit of knowing the sensitivity
derivatives of the variables on the other hand.
It must be noted that higher order sensitivity
derivatives may be obtained for X F and X by setting
higher order total derivatives of the two first stationary
conditions (Eqs. 2.3) to zero. In particular, Ref. 25 shows
how little additional calculation is required to find F",
once X' has been obtained.
2.4	ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
After solving a mathematical programming problem and
before performing sensitivity analysis, it is necessary to
find the set of the active constraints. These constraints
must satisfy Eqs. 2.3; furthermore, their gradients must be21QF:i zrr',AL! el-- y N:^

linearly independent, if one wants to obtain the Lagrange
multipliers from Eq. 2.10. The algorithm described below
was used with success.
i)Select an initial set S  of nearly satisfied
constraints by retaining those constraints whose
value is above a small negative tolerance.
ii)Identify S pa, the subset of S a which contains the
maximum number of constraints with independent
gradients. To achieve that, the constraint
gradients are taken as the columns of a rectangular
matrix and a Gaussian elimination with row and
column interchanges is performed to identify the
independent columns.
iii)Use Eq. 2.10 to find the Lagrange multipliers
corresponding to set S pa. Note that the fact that
the constraints of set Spa have independent
gradients is a guarantee that Eq. 2.10 has a
solution.
iv)Find the smallest Lagrange multiplier ai.
V)	If X. is negative (less than a small positive
tolerance), eliminate constraint i from set S  and
restart the process in ii). 	If X  is positive,
terminate the process since S'a is the desired set.22	'3F ? DR U` F_:
Note that steps ii) and iii) would not be required if QR
decomposition were used. In step v), only the constraints
with strictly positive Lagrange multipliers are kept, even
though active constraints may have Lagrange multipliers that
are zero. This is because constraints with zero Lagrange
multipliers are redundant; hence, their gradients are
linearly dependent on other constraint gradients.
In this work, the sensitivity derivatives are used to
extend optimization information over a range of variation
for the parameters of the design problems considered. This
is achieved by means of the linear extrapolations given in
Eq. 2.5. The implicit relationships 2.2 are expected to be
nonlinear, in general. Hence, the extrapolations being
first-order Taylor series expansions, they are valid only
for limited AP. Furthermore, the calculation of the
sensitivity derivatives is based on the assumption that the
set of constraints active at the initial optimum will remain
unchanged as the parameter P is changed to P+AP.
Perturbations of the parameters cause moves of the
constraint boundaries with respect to each other and,
therefore, may very well result in changes in the active
constraint set. These changes then imply reduced accuracy
of the extrapolated optima. The question arises of whether
it is possible to estimate the magnitude of the parameterOF POOR QvA° ITY
perturbations which cause changes in the active constraint
set. It was proposed in Ref. 22 that the perturbation of
parameter p (element of vector P) which results in
constraint i changing from active status to inactive status
may be obtained to the first order by stating that X  is
reduced to zero when constraint i leaves the active set,
Xi(P+APi) _ Xi(P)+Xi(P)APi = 0
or
Opi = -ai(P)/Xi(P)	(2.15)
Reference 22 likewise suggested that the perturbation of
parameter p causing constraint i to change from inactive
status to active status could be found as that value ep i for
which gi(p+Api) becomes zero.
gi(P+APi) = gi(P)+1gix(P)X'(P)1APi = 0
then
APi= -gi(P)/Igix( P)X'(P))	(2.16)
It was observed in Ref. 26 that Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 could be
unreliable. These estimates were used to determine with a
specific design problem example what parameter perturbations
cause changes in the status of the different constraints247^ "n
OF POOR QJAUTY
involved, attempting so to speak, to construct an history
of the active constraint set as p varies. This may not be
an appropriate approach. Indeed, Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 may be
used to estimate a Ap i for each of the problem constraints,
indicating when the status of a particular constraint is
supposed to change. However, only the smallest (in absolute
value) negative and positive of these dp i (Ap_ and 4p+)
should be taken into consideration. The extrapolations
based on sensitivity derivatives obtained at p should be
adequate for p+Ap - < p+pp 5 p+pp +, But any prediction
beyond that range (in particular prediction of change in the
active constraint set) should not be relied upon since it
would have been obtained with derivatives corresponding to
an inappropriate active constraint set. In essence, as
suggested in Ref. 23, the Ap i of Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 must be
regarded as bounds on Op. Barring excessive nonlinearity,
the range of ep defined by the intersection of these bounds
is that within which the extrapolations based on sensitivity
derivatives calculated at p should be reliable. 	In the
absence of changes in the active constraint set, the
accuracy of Eq. 	2.5 is limited only by the inherent
nonlinearity of the specific design problem considered.
Experiments conducted with various structural design
problems showed (Ref. 22) that linear-extrapolation-based25
N
estimates of optimum objective functions and design
variables fell within a few percent of actual optimization
result, for parameter variations of up to twenty percent;
the predictions often were better for the objective function
than for the design variables.(n^ niece,.

PRESENTATION OF THE ALGORITHM
This chapter is devoted to discussing an algorithm proposed
for the design of complex engineering systems. The method
is based on multilevel decomposition of the corresponding
design problems 	into	subproblems 	which	are	solved
separately. 	The algorithm is discussed in general terms.
This is done so as to avoid focusing on a particular
problem. 	The following chapter will be devoted to
investigating the applicability of the approach described
here to a specific problem. 	The abstract concepts
introduced here can be more easily put in a physical context
if this chapter and the following one are read
simultaneously. The presentation begins with a definition
of the type of multilevel decomposition considered and of
the components of that decomposition. Then, the discussion
centers on the formulation and solution of the subproblems.
Finally, the organization of the overall optimization is
discussed. 	The developments follow those by Sobieski in
Ref. 20.

3.1	DEFINITIONS
The starting point of this discussion is the task of
designing a system by finding a set of variables which
optimize a performance index while satisfying a number of
constraints. This will be referred to as the
overall problem. Assume that, for convenience, the overall
problem is decomposed into a number of subproblems, each of
which corresponds to the design of a subsystem, and has its
own sets of variables and constraints. The subproblems are
organized in a hierarchy as shown on Fig. 1. The subproblem
at the top of the hierarchy is the design of the whole
system, in very general terms. The next level deals with
major subsystems, the third one with subsystems of the major
subsystems, and so on. As one goes down the levels, the
details of the system become more and more precisely
defined. The subproblems are identified by two numbers ij
which define (i) the level of the subproblem, and (j) its
position on that level. 	The level numbers increase
downward, and the subproblem numbers increase, say, from
left to right. The hierarchy is assumed to have 1 levels,
there are n  subproblems on level i.
The whole design process is conducted iteratively,
starting at the highest level and going down. 	Each
subsystem is designed separately. 	The object of the
algorithm is to coordinate the design of the different28

subsystems so as to obtain optimum system performance by
resolving the trade-offs between the subsystems in a
rational fashion. This is achieved by manipulating two
types of interactions between the subproblems: the controls
and the responses. A control is a quantity selected in a
subproblem to influence another subproblem in the hierarchy.
A response is a quantity that reflects the effect the design
of one subproblem has on that of another subproblem. In
this work, we assume that the controls flow exclusively
downward in the hierarchy, while the responses flow
exclusively upward. This excludes situations where a
subproblem controls another subproblem on the same level
(lateral control) or on a higher level (reverse control).'
As represented symbolically on Fig. 2, each subproblem is
assumed to receive controls from higher level subproblems
through vector CI ij (control inputs in subproblem if), and
to receive responses from lower level subproblems through
vector RIij (response inputs in subproblem i1). Also, each
subproblem is assumed to control lower level subproblems
with vector COij (control outputs from subproblem i^), and
' In Ref. 20, the controls are named interaction quantities.
The interested reader should refer to that source for
indications as to how to handle reverse and lateral
controls.c) Highest level subproblem.

to respond to higher level subproblems with vector ROij
(response outputs from subproblem ice). This discussion does
not make any assumption on the specific form of the
controls, except that the control outputs from a subproblem
depend on the variables of that subproblem; they may be the
variables themselves or functions of these variables (CO .j =i
Coij(Xij)). Likewise, the controls imposed on subproblem ij
(CI ij) are not specified , except that they are assumed
known once all the control outputs from higher level
subproblems (Co ri, a<i) are known. The response outputs
from a subproblem (RO ij) will be defined in this chapter.
Furthermore, it will be shown that the response inputs into
a subproblem (RI ij) are entirely known once the response
outputs from the lower level subproblems (RO as, a>i) are
known.
For each iteration of the overall system, each subproblem
is concerned with finding a design which satisfies its own
constraints for the controls specified by the higher level
subproblems (CI ij). In addition, the subproblem manipulates
its own controls (CO..) so as to improve the responses from
the lower level subproblems (RI ij ).	Mathematically, this
implies finding a design vector that satisfies a set of0"KY A p P cn- n
32	OF POOR QUALITY
equality constraints and a set of inequality constraints.
This problem may be solved by transforming it into a
nonlinear mathematical programming problem where a measure
of constraint violation is minimized with respect to the
design vector. The subproblem's own response (RO ij) is then
constituted of the minimum measure of constraint violation
as well as derivatives indicating the sensitivity of that
minimum measure to changes in the controls imposed on the
subproblem.
The subproblem on the highest level of the hierarchy
drives the whole design process. It selects its own design
variables so as to optimize the overall problem performance
index and satisfy its own constraints. It adjusts its
controls (CO 11) to improve the responses from the lower
levels (RI 11), that is, reduce the constraint violation in
the lower level subproblems.
3.2 	 LOWEST LEVEL SUBPROBLEM
Figure 2 a) describes symbolically subproblem lj, a
subproblem on the lowest level of the hierarchy. The vector
of design variables is X lj, the subproblem design is
influenced by the controls collected in vector CI lj and the
subproblem response is vector RO lj.	The subproblem

The functions g lj and elj are vector-valued. The subproblem
design is subject to a set of inequality constraints (Eq.
3.1.a). These are the constraints set on the corresponding
subsystem in the statement of the overall non-decomposed
problem. The design is also subject to a set of equality
constraints (Eq. 3.1.b). Some of these may come from the
formulation of the overall non-decomposed problem; some are
imposed on the subproblem during decomposition. The
multilevel decomposition consists of different models of the
system being designed, the models becoming more refined as
one progresses down the hierarchy. The equality constraints
arise from the necessity of requiring consistency between
the models at different levels. Also, some upper and lower
bounds may be set on the variables (Eq. 3.1.c). As stated
in the previous section, the subproblem is assumed to be
controlled by each subproblem on the higher levels. As a
result, the vector of controls CI lj is functionally
dependent on the optimum designs of all the subproblems
above the lowest level.34

relax inequality and equality constraints. These new

where b is a positive constant. Each equality constraint is
replaced by two inequality constraints (Eq. 3.3.c). The
distance between these constraints (2n ij ) is forced to
remain positive because of Eq. 3.3.e and to decrease because
of the second term in the objective function. 	Each
inequality constraint is relaxed by the addition of variable
E: mechanism of that relaxation is described in Fig.
3, for a simple two-dimensional problem with one equality
and three inequality constraints, assuming that the equality
constraint is identically satisfied. The first term in the
objective function (Eq. 3.3.a) is defined so as to increase
Eli . A high positive value for Eli is quite acceptable as
it means that the selected design point is deep inside the
feasible domain, away from the constraint boundaries, and
that decreases the chances of obtaining infeasible designs
when the controls are perturbed. If the solution of Problem
3.3 is so that Eli z 0 and Ti lj = 0, then it solves Problem
3.1. If, on the other hand, we have Elj < 0 or Ti lj x 0,
then the resulting design is infeasible with respect to
Problem 3.1.
Constant b is added to the definition of the objective
function to control the importance attributed to violatingOF POOP: QJA i"d Y
the different constraints. A high value for b results in a
heavy penalty paid for violating equality constraints;
conversely, a low value for b makes the penalty for
violating inequality constraints more important, in relative
terms. In addition to adjusting b, it may prove appropriate
to scale variables E1j and n1j in order to make all
components of the constraint gradients of the same order of
magnitude.
Any nonlinear programming algorithm may be used to solve
Problem 3.3. 	This yields X lj, as well as a measure of
inequality constraint violation E1j and a measure of
equality constraint violation n1j. These are functionally
dependent on the controls CI 1j and, therefore, as indicated
by Eq. 3.2, on the optimum design variables of subproblems
on higher levels. Optimum sensitivity analysis may be used
to study the effect changes in higher level subproblem
variables have on the constraint violations for subproblem
lj.	Considering £1j, if all higher level subproblem
designs are perturbed, we have

extrapolations of the type of Eq. 3.4.b, their coefficients
being available from the responses RI ij.	They require
satisfaction of equality and inequality constraints in lower41	OF POOR QU ^4 9TY

more general expression is given at the end of this section.
The increment AX.. corresponds to the change of X ij with13
respect to the previous optimum design, or, the current
initial design, hence AX ij = Xij -Xij.	Constraints 3.7.f
are called move limits; they limit the changes in the
variables X.. to a fixed fraction S of the initial values ofij
these variables. This is done to preserve the validity of
the sensitivity-analysis-based linear extrapolations of Eqs.
3.7.c and d (see Sec. 2.4).

This organization specifies that the algorithm progresses
top-down rather than bottom-up as suggested in Ref. 20. The
disadvantage of conducting the optimization as proposed here
is that the first iteration must be done without responses
from lower level subproblems. Therefore, that iteration may
be considered wasted as the first subproblem designs will
not have been obtained with full consideration for the
requirements from those lower level subproblems. However,
this negative effect will be somewhat tempered if the move
limits (Eqs. 3.8.h and 3.14.f) are kept for the subproblems
above the lowest level. The argument for proceeding top-
down is the need for accounting for changes in lower level
subproblem response inputs while optimizing a subproblem on
a given level (see term in ARI uV in Eq. 3.12). If
optimization were conducted bottom-up, the sensitivity
derivatives making up a subproblem RO VV would be calculated
for a given RIuv but would be used in a higher level
subproblem in the same iteration before new RI PVvalues were
generated, therefore making it impossible to calculate
ARI11V
If the decomposition involves only two levels, the
objection 	to	conducting 	the	optimization 	bottom-up
disappears as there is no ARI 	term to calculate. 	Butuv
then, there is little difference between top-down and50	 ORIGINAL P!a^`:^ r::

bottom-up optimization. It is only a matter of deciding
whether optimization will start at the top or at the bottom;
from that point, the optimizations of the different levels
follow always in the same sequence.
3.6	MOVE LIMIT SELECTION
The move limits of Problems 3.8 and 3.14 may be chosen on
the basis of experience, or, using the bound estimates of
Sec. 2.4. When optimization is conducted with fixed move
limits, it is observed that the design first progresses
steadily towards the optimum solution but does not settle;
rather, it oscillates about that solution. During these
oscillations, an excessive number of switches in the active
constraint set occur, thereby preventing the process from
converging. This situation is similar to that observed when
solving a nonlinear mathematical programming problem as a
sequence of linearized problems. When that type of method
is used, similar oscillations are encountered if the optimum
of the initial problem does not lie at a vertex of the
feasible domain; the solutions of successive linear problems
oscillate between adjacent vertices of that domain. As
discussed by Pope (Ref. 27), an approach to overcome that
difficulty is to reduce the move limits as the oscillating
behavior appears. This approach was successfully followed
in this study.S1
3.7	FINAL COMMENTS
This chapter discusses an approach for optimizing decomposed
design problems. It must be emphasized that no firm rule is
established for devising a decomposition method. For a
specific problem, the decomposition must be made on the
basis of practical experience. As pointed out by Sobieski
(Ref. 20) the large design problems for which this type of
approach is conceived have always been treated in decomposed
form. For major projects, the design process is carried out
by the design office of a company (or even several
companies). 'That office is itself divided into specialty
groups and subgroups each of which handles the design of a
particular type of subsystem using its own codes and
analytic tools. 	The team managing the design is then
concerned with resolving the trade-offs. The proposed
method offers a means for doing this with a systematic
mathematical procedure; furthermore, it lends itself to
parallel or distributed computer processing.
Before applying the proposed method to a problem, the
decomposition must be defined. This implies a definition of
the different subproblems and the choice of their design
variables and constraints. The structure of the controls
must be identified as well. For the sake of generality, the
developments of this chapter make the assumption that each52
subproblem controls each lower level subproblem; as a
consequence, each subproblem responds to each higher level
subproblem. Clearly, this situation is undesirable from an
economic standpoint. An expensive item in the scheme
remains the calculation of the sensitivity derivatives, as
these require calculation of second-order behavioral
derivatives (Chap. 2). Therefore, as a general rule, the
number of controls should be kept as low as possible.
Practical experience should help in determining what control
or response must be accounted for. In particular, controls
or responses yielding typically low sensitivity derivatives
(aeij/aCIij	and aeij/aRIij	in Eq. 	3.10)	should be
ignored.
A key point of this discussion is the approach chosen for
finding individual subproblem designs (solution of Problems
3.1,	3.7,	and	3.13).	Two	additional variables 	are
introduced in each subproblem. 	These monitor the most
violated equality and inequality constraints. This
particular formulation was used because i) it permits
equality constraints to be treated numerically, and ii) it
is compatible with the use of a usable-feasible direction
algorithm for solving the individual subproblems. It must
be noted that other approaches could be used as well.
Reference 21 discusses an example based on a penaltyS3

function formulation, where a cumulative measure involving
all the constraints of the problem (except side constraints
and move limits) is minimized.Chapter IV
APPLICATION OF THE ALGORITHM TO THE DESIGN OF A
SAILPLANE WING
This chapter demonstrates the applicability of the proposed
algorithm to the problem of designing a high-performance
sailplane wing. To achieve this goal, we describe the
proposed decomposition. We identify the subproblems, their
design variables, and the different control and response
vectors. The objective of the overall problem is taken to
be the optimization of a classical performance index called
the cross-country speed. Clearly, to efficiently design an
airplane, one must optimize its entire configuration all at
once. However, in order to reduce the problem size, we
focus our efforts on the wing design, in effect solving the
problem of redesigning the wing of an existing sailplane.
We assume that the description of the other sailplane
components is entirely known. The variables of the overall
problem describe the wing shape and its structure. 	The
decomposition has four levels (see Fig. 4).
The top level of the hierarchy is occupied by a
subproblem that selects global performance parameters. This
drives an aerodynamic subproblem on the second level where
the wing shape is designed to the specified performance
characteristics. 	The synthesis of the wing structure is
54Figure 4: Four-level hierarchy for performance sailplane
wing design problem.OF POOR QU `^:,l17Y
done on the two lower levels. The third level deals with
the determination of spanwise distributions of global
structural characteristics, and the fourth level is
concerned with the detailed design of wing elements. The
subproblems are identified by the following subscripts: p
for performance subproblem, a for aerodynamic subproblem, g
for global structural subproblem, and lj for j_th local
structural subproblem. The developments were carried out to
a point where computer implementation is possible. 	The
details of the formulation are given in Apps. A-D.
4.1	PERFORMANCE SUBPROBLEM
A performance subproblem occupies the highest level of the
hierarchy, and it drives the whole design process. Its task
is to select a combination of performance parameters which
maximize the sailplane's cross-country speed. The cross-
country speed is defined as the average speed the sailplane
achieves over a typical flight segment. It is shown in App.
A that the variables entering the calculation of that
performance index are: the sailplane gross weight (W), its
planform area (S), the coefficients (C DO' CD1' CD2) of a
performance curve called the drag polar, and the maximum
lift coefficient (CLmax). These variables will be taken as
the performance variables.
T
X 	€W'S'C DO' C Dl' CD2'CLmax} 	(4.1)57
OF poc;k Qu >;.;,''y'J
The design will be subjected to the constraint that the
sailplane be capable of a minimum rate of climb in a typical
thermal updraft. The variables may be divided into two
groups. On the one hand, the weight selected on the basis
of performance considerations controls the structural design
by determining the amount of structural material available.
On the other hand, the remaining variables (referred to as
aerodynamic performance variables) control the aerodynamic
design by specifying the aerodynamic characteristics
required from the wing. This is, of course, a statement
that optimization of an airplane entails carefully
integrated aerodynamic and structural designs. The control
outputs of the performance subproblem are therefore the
performance variables themselves.
CO  = X 	 (4.2)
4.2	AERODYNAMIC SUBPROBLEM
The wing is narrow, unswept, and twisted, and it has a
double taper (see Fig. 14). 	Its airfoil is chosen from a
standard catalog which details its parameters. 	The
objective of the aerodynamic subproblem is the selection of58	
ORIGINAL P GE FS

the wing geometry which corresponds to the values of
planform area, drag polar coefficients and maximum lift
coefficient specified in the performance subproblem (these
will be referred to as target aerodynamic performance
variables). As detailed in App. B, the aerodynamic
variables include the wing semispan (b) and the spanwise
position of the taper change (b b). Also included among the
variables are the section chord at the root, break, and tip
(cr,cb,ct), the section maximum thickness at the root,
break, and tip (t r,tb,tt), and, finally, the wing twist
angle at the break and the tip ( Eb,Et). Hence,
Xa = 2 b,bbfcr'Cb,Ct,tr,tb,tt,Eb,EtS	(4.3)
Once these variables are known, it is possible to calculate
the resulting wing aerodynamic performance variables. By
requiring that these must equal the target values specified
in the performance subproblem, we obtain six equality
constraints among the components of X a. Furthermore, one
inequality constraint is added which forces the initiation
of stall at an inboard wing section. As explained in App.
B, the calculation of sailplane aerodynamic performance
characteristics takes into account the effect of the
Reynolds number, and therefore, the sailplane weight must be
known. The vector of control inputs into the aerodynamic59	OF POUR Q'U'A {T1(
subproblem includes then the target values for the
aerodynamic performance characteristics and also the
sailplane weight.
CI  = X 	 (4.4)
The aerodynamic design controls the structural design
through two major elements: the wing shape and the
aerodynamic loads. The former determines the root bending
moment as well as the size of the load bearing part of the
section; 	the	latter	clearly	influences 	the	total
distribution of loads. All the aerodynamic variables are
required for calculating the wing shape and the aerodynamic
loads, therefore
CO  = X 	 (4.5)
Finally,the vector of response outputs from the aerodynamic
subproblem is given by Eq. 3.11.

The sailplane gross weight was specified in the performance

components is fixed, the weight allocated to the wing (the
target weight) is known. At this level, the wing is modeled
as a straight beam. This subproblem objective is the
selection of global wing structural characteristics, that
is: the spanwise distributions of weight per unit length,
bending and torsional stiffnesses. 	These are written as
superpositions of interpolating polynomials, the
coefficients of which are taken as the subproblem design
variables and are referred to as wing stiffnesses (see App.
C),

The compatibility between w j, EIj and GJ j is enforced at the
lowest level when the detailed synthesis forces the element
designs to match the global level stiffnesses. The design
is subjected to one equality constraint that specifies that
the total wing weight equals the target weight selected in
the performance subproblem. 	In addition, 	two global
structural inequality constraints are added. 	The wing
bending displacements must be limited, and its torsional
divergence speed must exceed a given minimum. The
calculation of these constraints requires the wing shape, a
number of aerodynamic load parameters and, of course, the
target weight. The wing shape (vector H) is a function of61
OF Poor,
the aerodynamic variables, while the target weight (W) is a
function of the performance variables. The aerodynamic load
parameters (vector A) are themselves functions of the wing
shape and the sailplane weight as shown in App. B. Hence,
the vector of control inputs into the subproblem is	
CI TT =W(Xp),HT(Xa),AT(Xa,W(Xp M	 (4.8)
The choice of the wing stiffnesses controls the design of
the details of structure, hence

4.4	LOCAL STRUCTURAL SUBPROBLEMS
The fourth level of the hierarchy is devoted to designing
the details of the wing to match the stiffness distributions
chosen by the global level subproblem. To achieve this, the
wing is divided into n  constant property elements (see Fig.OF POOR QUALITY
22), each of which is designed in a separate subproblem.
The design variables describing one element include the
cross-sectional dimensions of the spar caps (a,t c), the
thicknesses of the sandwich panels constituting the leading
and trailing edge shells (tf,tfs) and the spar webs
(tw,tfw), and the rib spacing (d). Hence,
T
Xlj = a j,tcj,tsj,tfsj,twj,tfwj,dj1	 (4.11)
The variables are subjected to three equality constraints
insuring that the element stiffnesses equal the target
values (vector Kj) specified at the global structural level.
Furthermore, it is required that the elements withstand
applied end loads (vector Mj) without failure or local
buckling. App. D shows that the calculation of the
stiffnesses involves the element gross dimensions (vector
Hj); these are functions of the aerodynamic variables.
Also, the applied end loads (Mj) computation must be based
on the vector describing the wing shape (H), a function of
the aerodynamic variables, the vector of aerodynamic load
parameters (A), a function of aerodynamic variables and
weight, and the global structural variables (X g) to account
for the effect of inertia loads. Hence,

This decomposition conforms to the general form defined in
Chap. III; in particular, it does not contain reverse or
network controls. This is because the following effects are
neglected (see Apps. B and C): i) effect of wing
flexibility on aerodynamic characteristics, ii) effect of
changes in wing section elastic axis position on torsional
divergence speed, and, iii) effect of changes in wing
section center of gravity position on inertia-force-induced
torque. To account for i), one must include reverse
controls between the global structural and aerodynamic
subproblems. Effects ii) and iii) require reverse controls
between local structural and global structural subproblems.OF POOR 	 E' `Y
Chapter V
TWO-LEVEL MINIMUM WEIGHT WING DESIGN
A complete numerical application of the algorithm presented
in Chap. III is appropriate, but it was decided that
computer implementation of the four-level high-performance
sailplane design problem formulated in Chap. IV and Apps.
A-D would be a task well beyond the scope of this research.
A more limited and manageable but still significant
application of the algorithm is the minimum weight design of
the sailplane wing. This corresponds to the two lower
levels of the hierarchy described by Fig. 4, except that the
objective function of the overall problem, and therefore of
the top level of the decomposed problem, is now the total
wing weight. The global structural subproblem now has the
form of Problem 3.13. 	The objective function (F(X11)
F(X9)) is the weight, and there are three inequality
constraints (g11(X11) g9(X9)); two set upper and lower
limits on the wing tip displacement, one provides a lower
bound for the wing torsional divergence speed (see App. C).
The weight and stiffness distributions are Lagrangian
interpolations defined on five equal length intervals (ns =
5), thereby requiring six coefficients per distribution, for
a total of eighteen global level variables (X 9). The five
6768	OF POOR QUAU -n ^
local structural subproblems are formulated as in Problem
3.1. Each one is described by seven design variables (Xlj ).
The vector of constraints (glj(Xlj)) contains twelve
constraints on stresses, five on buckling (only the buckling
of the sandwich panels is considered, that of the spar caps
is ignored, see App. D). Also three constraints are
included which limit the ratios of spar cap width to element
chord and of sandwich panel total thickness to face sheet
thickness (see App. E). Finally, three equality constraints
(e1j(X1j)) require that the element weight per unit length,
bending and torsional stiffnesses equal the target values
specified at the global structural level (see App. D).
The multilevel decomposition for this two-level problem
corresponds to the two lower levels of the hierarchy of Fig.
4 except that the definition of the wing planform is now
assumed fixed so that the vectors of wing shape (H) and
element gross shape (H j) are constant throughout the
optimization. Furthermore, the effect of the sailplane
weight (W(X P)) on the aerodynamic parameters is ignored so
that vector A is constant as well. The control inputs into
local structural subproblem lj (CI lj) are then the vectors
of target stiffnesses (Kj) and end loads (M.). The response
outputs from that subproblem are given by Eq. 4.13, without
the sensitivity derivative with respect to H.. The responseOF POOR QjA- i -T Y
inputs into the global structural subproblem are given by
Eq. 4.14 where the participation factor Tlg is set to unity
as the global structural subproblem is the only one that
controls the local structural level subproblems. The
numerical values of the parameters needed for the
calculations of Apps. A-D are given in App. E.
5.1	 TEST DESCRIPTION
Two test cases will be described. The first starts from the
feasible domain, all the constraints being satisfied with
ample margins. 	The second starts from the infeasible
domain. It is such that, at the global level, the tip
displacement exceeds its upper limit by 130%, while the
divergence dynamic pressure is 10% below its lower limit.
With the exception of the tip element, all the wing elements
have a large proportion of stress and buckling constraints
violated, resulting in measures of inequality constraint
violation (E lj) ranging from -3.0 to -6.0. In both cases,
an initial design was given for each wing element and the
stiffnesses of these elements were calculated. Trial and
error was then used to determine the global level
stiffnesses whose averages would yield back the local level
stiffnesses just calculated, in accordance with Eq. C.23.3.

Figure 5 gives the convergence history for the test

feasible design with a stabilized weight of 1030 N. (for two
wings), with the differences in the final values being less
than 1%. The design started in the feasible domain achieves
a weight reduction of 68%. That begun in the infeasible
region gains barely 6% of weight as it redistributes the
structural material in an attempt to satisfy the violated
constraints. Both final solutions have the divergence
constraint critical, while the upper displacement constraint
is satisfied with a margin of about 25%. The designs of
wing elements 1 (inboard), 2 and 4 are critical or near
critical (-.01 5 e S .07), while those of elements 3 and 5
(outboard) are not (e > .10). The active constraints for
the critical elements are: i) the stress constraints in the
carbon fiber spar caps, and primarily in the lower one, ii)
the shear buckling constraint for the upper and lower
sandwich panels of the trailing edge shell and the rear spar
web, iii) the constraint setting an upper limit on the spar
cap width to section chord ratio (a/c). 	Furthermore, for
each element, the rib spacing d is against its upper limit,
3 Unless otherwise specified, one iteration corresponds to
one complete optimization of the overall problem. It
entails one optimization of the global structural
subproblem, one optimization and one sensitivity analysis

while the spar web face sheet thickness is against its lower
limit.	The parameter b in the local level subproblem
objective function (Problem 3.3) was set to 100. At the
global level, the objective function parameters (c and d,
see Problem 3.14) were chosen so that, at the beginning of
each global level optimization, the penalty term in the
objective function (-c£11+dell) was ten times the weight
(F(X11)). As a consequence, all equality constraints were
satisfied, after most system iteration, to within 1%, or
less (n !- .O1).

(solid symbols). This is probably evidence that the optimum
is fairly "flat". In other words, the global level design
may be perturbed without drastically changing the overall
design quality measured in terms of minimum objective
function and constraint satisfaction. Three factors may be
contributing to that situation. First, due to the
relationship between the number of coefficients in the
global level wing model (6 per distribution of weight per
unit length, bending and torsional stiffnesses) and the
number of wing elements (5), there is an infinite number of
global level designs which yield the same local level target
values. Second, it may be proven algebraically that all the
combinations of global level weights which result in the
same local level target weights actually result in the same
total wing weight (this can be shown easily for Lagrangian
interpolations based on an odd number of equal length
intervals). Third, all the global level constraints (in the
untransformed subproblem) are integral constraints (see App.
C). The integration process should be expected to smooth
out the effect of variations in global level stiffness
distributions.
The distributions of stiffnesses are wavy; this must be
related to the order of the interpolating polynomials used
to model them. These polynomials are of the fifth order in7 6	GFEX L PAC-2 713
Our POOR Q'UAZATY
the present model. 	It would be interesting to model the
wing weight and stiffness distributions with lower-order
polynomials; this should reduce the wavyness while
necessitating fewer variables in the global structural
subproblem and making the global and local structural models
independent. This would, however, require a new definition
of the relationship between the global level weights and
stiffnesses and the corresponding local level target values
(Eq. C.23).
Table 1 compares numerically the initial and final
designs for the inboard and outboard elements. As expected,
the trend observed among the target stiffnesses is repeated
at the lower level; the two designs obtained for the inboard
wing element are very close, while those for the outboard
element differ substantially. This general trend can be
intuitively understood as the overall wing response must be
more sensitive to the design of the wing root which carries
the total wing load than to that of the wing tip which is
almost unloaded.

element when optimization is started from the infeasible
domain.	A short digression is necessary to explain the
physical meaning of variables E and n. For an infeasible
design, E measures the violation of the most violated
constraint; for a feasible design it gives an indication of
the margin associated with the constraint which is the
closest to being critical. For example, if we refer to a
design problem involving a single inequality constraint on
displacement u (g(X) = u(X)/u max- 1 5 0), a value of -1.5 for
E indicates that displacement u exceeds its maximum value
umax by 150%, while a value of 0.5 means that the
displacement is only 50% of its upper limit. 	Variable n
measures the violation of the most violated equality
constraint of a subproblem. Considering a subproblem
subjected to the requirement that a function f of its design
variables remain equal to a target value f t (e(X) _
f(X)/ft-1 = 0), a value of .25 for n means that f(X) is 25%
away from ft.
Returning to Fig. 8, the solid lines give the evolution
Of E12 and n12. They describe the evolution of these
optimum quantities throughout the design process, each value
being obtained at the end of a complete optimization of
subproblem 12. 	The dots correspond to the estimates of

notation 	of	Chap.	III	(see	Problem 	3.13).	The
interpretation of the graph may be aided by an example. At
the end of iteration 3 1	E12 is -1.3S; 	the global
structural subproblem improves its design at the beginning
of iteration 4 and predicts that this will result in a
change to -.68 while E12 actually is reduced to -.78 when
local structural subproblem 12 is optimized.
From Fig. 8, one can observe that the algorithm
effectively reduces the violation of inequality constraints
while keeping the violation of equality constraints within
1%, most of the time. The success is a result of the
generally good prediction of these measures by the global
structural 	subproblem. 	Occasionally, 	however, 	the
predictions are poor, as for iterations 6, 22 and 24 for
E12, and 10 for T) 12*	The bad predictions can be
correlated with changes in the set of constraints
determining the successive solutions to subproblem 12; as
discussed in Sec. 2.4, these changes do introduce
discontinuities in the sensitivity derivatives. This slows
down the convergence process, but the algorithm appears
robust enough to overcome the difficulty; this observation
is consistent with the results of Ref. 21. It must be noted81	 ORICI"1,11 PAGE IS
OF POOR Q'. AL117Y
that the occurrence of active constraint switching does not
always produce discontinuities as significant as those
observed here. As a matter of fact, about 60% of the
optimizations included in the example presented end with
changes in the active constraint set, but only 15% seem
really affected by the change.
5.4 	 ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
As was pointed out in Chap. III, limits must be set on the
global level variables to insure that the sensitivity-
derivative-based linear extrapolations of the local level
measures of constraint violation are not used beyond their
range of validity. 	Upper and lower bounds could be
estimated for these limits, using Eqs. 2.25 and 2.16.
However, it was elected not to do so in this study. The two
test cases presented here were started with move limits
allowing changes of ± 10% in the global level variables at
each iteration of the overall problem (b = .10 in Eq.
3.13.f). As the process neared the optimum solution, these
limits were reduced as discussed in Sec. 3.6. For example,
in the test case started from the infeasible starting point,
the move limits were kept at 10% during the first 5
iterations, 5% for iterations 6-21, 2.5% for iterations
22-25, and finally, 1% for the last three iterations. 	It82	 ORI4ti-I'A PACE a

must be pointed out that no attempt was made to refine the
bound selection strategy nor to identify the widest usable
bounds for the first steps of the process. Doing so could
probably improve the convergence characteristics of the
algorithm.
The impact of active constraint switching on the rate of
convergence is related to the specifics of the solution of
the individual subproblems. This approach tracks the most
violated equality and inequality constraints. Therefore, a
relatively large number of changes in the active constraint
set may be expected. By contrast, the approach of Ref. 21
combines most constraints (except upper and lower bounds and
move limits) in a penalty function which is continuous in
the constraints. That approach should not result in so many
changes. The question of which approach provides the best
rate of convergence may be answered only by using both
approaches to solve the same design problem.
Early tests with this algorithm revealed a situation that
deserves comment. In some circumstances, the subproblem
solution may not be unique. An example of this is depicted
on Fig. 9 where the subproblem involves one equality
constraint that is parallel to one of the sides of the
domain defined by the inequality constraints. Assuming that
the equality constraint is satisfied at the outset of the91 +

optimization, we see that each point of segment AB is a
solution. This situation does not cause difficulties
during optimization of the subproblem. However, it leads to
singular sensitivity matrices. 	This can be shown on the
example. As none of the subproblem objective function
(e-E+bn) or active constraints depend on variables x 2, the
corresponding row and column of the sensitivity equations
(Eq. 2.14) are identically zero. This difficulty may be
overcome by eliminating the null row and column from the
equation. In this problem, the situation appeared when the
design process was started with all variables at lower
bounds.
To conclude this chapter, a few words about the
implementation are in order. A special purpose FORTRAN
computer program was developed to carry out the examples
described. It was run in batch on an IBM 3081 processor.
Three iterations were run at a time and results from
successive iterations were kept on a direct access data file
so as to provide the capability for restarting the
optimization from any iteration. 	Individual subproblems
were optimized with the usable-feasible direction algorithm
implemented in subroutine CONMIN (Ref. 28). 	For the two
examples discussed, 	convergence was 	achieved in 28
iterations; a typical iteration took 30-35 CPU seconds. Of85
that time, about 60% was devoted to optimizing the global
structural subproblem, while the remaining 40% was split
evenly between optimization and sensitivity analysis of the
5 local level subproblems. During one iteration of the
overall problem, optimization of the global level subproblem
took an average of 18 iterations to converge. Each global
level iteration required about 21 function evaluations
(weight, wing tip displacement and wing divergence dynamic
pressure). At the local level, a wing element design took
an average of 38 iterations. 	Each local level iteration
required about 11 function evaluations (stiffnesses,
stresses and buckling constraints), while each local level
sensitivity analysis required 531 function evaluations. The
numbers of function evaluations reported above include those
required for derivative calculations. For reasons of
convenience, all derivatives for optimization were obtained
by forward difference formulae, those for sensitivity
analysis were found by central difference formulae.0!r^aJliY9 :liA- i

DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This work centers on a multilevel decomposition approach to
the optimization of large problems. The starting point is
Sobieski's original idea (Ref. 20) of using optimum
sensitivity analysis to account for the coupling between the
different subproblems of a decomposed problem. The
objective of this research was the investigation of the
applicability of Sobieski's algorithm to the design of
complex engineering systems. The three major contributions
of this dissertation are: i) a presentation of an extended
version of the algorithm, ii) an illustration of the
applicability of the algorithm to a realistic
multidisciplinary design problem, and, iii) an application
of the proposed algorithm. This chapter summarizes these
developments and offers some recommendations.
6.1	ON THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM
The algorithm we developed is very general; in contrast with
previously introduced multilevel approaches, it does not
make restrictive assumptions as to the mathematical nature
of the problem considered nor is it developed for a specific
class of physical problems. Rather, it is devised for the
8687
optimization of large systems which may be decomposed into
subsystems.
We hypothesize an existing decomposition of the overall
problem into smaller subproblems. It is assumed that the
decomposition is multilevel and hierarchical; that is, the
subproblems are organized on levels corresponding to
progressively more refined models of the system designed
and, furthermore, the subproblems on a given level exert
control on the design of the subproblems on lower levels.
The controls must be defined with the hierarchy. It is
finally assumed that the subproblems entail finding a design
that satisfies a set of equality and inequality constraints.
An iterative procedure is then used where each subproblem
is designed separately by minimization of a measure of
constraint violation, for fixed values of the controls
imposed by higher level subproblems. Sensitivity
derivatives of the resulting subproblem solution are
generated which constitute the response of that subproblem
to the higher level subproblem controls. Each subproblem is
designed with additional constraints which require
improvement of the lower level subproblem responses. This
algorithm specifically allows for the extreme situation
where a subproblem controls each lower level subproblem,
and, as a consequence, each subproblem responds to each88	 ORIGINAL PAGE' M
OF POOR QUALITY
N
higher level subproblem. The highest level of the hierarchy
is occupied by a single subproblem which drives the whole
design process. Its task is the optimization of the overall
problem objective with respect to variables which describe
the system in very general terms. This subproblem also
manipulates its controls to improve the lower level
subproblem designs.
The specifics of the solution of the individual
subproblems differ from those of Ref. 21, where equality
constraints are handled analytically by elimination of
dependent variables, while the independent variables are
found by minimization of a penalty function. The present
approach introduces two additional variables which measure
i) the violation of the most violated inequality constraint
(or the margin of the constraints which are the closest to
being critical), and ii) the violation of the most violated
equality constraint. These variables are then combined in a
cumulative measure of violation which is minimized to find
the "best" subproblem design. The advantage of this
approach is that it is more general in that it handles
equality constraints numerically. Furthermore, it is
compatible with the use of a usable-feasible direction
algorithm.ORIGINAL PAGE IS
89	 OF POOR QUALITY
This discussion shows that when the decomposition
contains more than two levels, it becomes necessary to
consider the sensitivity of a given subproblem above the
lowest level not only to the control inputs into that
subproblem, as shown in Ref. 20, but also to the response
inputs into that subproblem, as well as to the initial
design for that subproblem. Of course, it may be argued
that ignoring such effects will only slow down the
convergence of the overall process while resulting in fewer
sensitivity analyses and in an easier implementation. This
question must be resolved by testing a simple three-level
problem for which a solution is known or easy to generate.
All that is required before using this algorithm is a
choice of the decomposition of the overall problem into
subproblems, and of the .controls between the subproblems.
These choices must be made on the basis of practical
experience accumulated with the type of systems considered.
The decomposition must correspond to the general description
given above. Intuitively, the number of controls should be
kept to a minimum; the decision of whether to include a
specific control or not could be helped by analysis of the
sensitivity of the optimum of the subproblem being
controlled to the control considered.90	
	 ORIGINAL PAGE IS
OF POOR QUALITY
6.2	ON THE APPLICABILITY OF THE ALGORITHM
The applicability of the algorithm was illustrated by
formulation of a realistic multidisciplinary design problem:
the simultaneous aerodynamic and structural design of
sailplane wing for maximum cross-country speed. A
multilevel decomposition conforming to the desired general
form was developed. 	The highest level is occupied by a
subproblem 	which	selects	the	sailplane 	performance
parameters that maximize the cross-country speed. Then
follows an aerodynamic subproblem which determines the wing
shape that produces the aerodynamic performance parameters
selected at the level above and meets a stall-related
constraint. 	On the third level, a global structural
subproblem chooses the distributions of wing weight and
stiffnesses which satisfy constraints on wing tip
displacement and divergence dynamic pressure for a total
weight equal to that selected in the performance subproblem.
Finally, at the lowest level, a number of structural
subproblems are concerned with finding wing element designs
which yield the stiffnesses specified by the global
structural subproblem while satisfying stress and buckling
constraints.
The controls of this decomposition were chosen by
considering the rigorous functional dependence of a given91
subproblem optimum on the variables of the higher level
subproblems. As a consequence, the weight, a performance
variable, controls all subproblems below the highest level;
likewise, the wing shape vector, a combination of
aerodynamic variables, controls the two structural levels.
This underscores the need for an algorithm that allows each
subproblem to control each lower level subproblem.
The formulation of this design problem was carried to a
point where computer implementation is possible. Its
completion can prove to be a very instructive exercise,
especially as -:.he initial theoretical developments related
to the proposed algorithm show that handling problems with
more than two levels may require calculations that were not
necessary for two-level problems.
6.3	ON THE EXAMPLE PROBLEM
The proposed algorithm has been applied to the two-level
minimum weight design of the sailplane wing. The tests show
that it is effective at producing low weight feasible
designs whether optimization is started from the feasible
domain or the infeasible one.
The numerical experiments conducted confirm that as
optimization progresses, changes occur in the sets of
constraints 	defining 	the	optima	of	the	different92
subproblems. These changes occasionally cause
discontinuities in the sensitivity derivatives, and these
may even result in oscillations about the optimum solution.
Although the algorithm successfully overcomes these
discontinuities, they still result in delayed convergence.
The susceptibility of a particular algorithm to active
constraint switching depends on the specific approach used
to optimize the individual subproblems. This point should
be investigated carefully prior to undertaking any large-
scale implementation of the algorithm. A good basis for
comparison could be obtained by solving a small two-level
problem using all candidate subproblem formulations.REFERENCES

PERFORMANCE SUBPROBLEM
The design of an airplane is always driven by the desire to
obtain the best possible value of a given performance index.
In this application, we will maximize the sailplane best
cross-country speed, that is, maximize the best average
speed the sailplane can achieve over a segment of flight
which starts with a high-speed glide and follows with a
circling climb in a thermal to recover the height lost
during the glide. In addition, we will require that the
sailplane achieves a minimum rate of climb in a typically
weak thermal. 	The design variables optimized in this
subproblem are the sailplane weight, wing area, maximum lift
coefficient, 	and	the	parameters 	relating 	its	drag
coefficient to its lift coefficient.
This appendix describes the calculations required to
obtain the sailplane best cross-country speed and rate of
climb as required for the optimization of the performance
subproblem.

A.2	SAILPLANE PERFORMANCE CURVES
A.2.1	Drag Polar
The performance of a sailplane in gliding flight may be
described by a curve that relates total drag coefficient to
total lift coefficient. That curve is named the drag polar,
it is essentially parabolic in shape; we will assume the
following form
where the coefficients CDO, CD1 and CD2 depend mainly on the
sailplane aerodynamic design and on its weight.
A.2.2	Speed Polar
As a sailplane flies unaccelerated on a straight trajectory
in undisturbed air the lift and the drag combined
equilibrate exactly the weight (see Fig. 10). The

the sailplane pilot since it allows him to know the altitude

speed.
A.2.3	Circling Polar
A sailplane circling at constant speed in undisturbed air is
depicted in Fig. 11. 	It flies on a helical trajectory of
constant radius r about a vertical axis. In the plane of
symmetry of the sailplane, the similarity between the
triangles of speeds and forces yields
vsc/V = D/L = C D/CL	(A.10)
In the vertical plane containing the center of gravity of
the sailplane, we see that the vertical rate of sink v sc is
now related to the rate of sink in the plane of symmetry

A.3	A SAILPLANE PERFORMANCE INDEX: THE CROSS-COUNTRY SPEED
A.3.1	Soaring
A sailplane is usually towed to altitude by another
airplane, a winch or even a car. If the pilot encounters
only motionless air, he will trade his altitude for the
speed needed to sustain flight. To keep his altitude and
really soar, the pilot must find regions of rising air.
Three soaring techniques are frequently used: thermal
soaring, ridge soaring and wave soaring (See Ref. 29).
In thermal soaring, the source of lift (lift is meant
here as upward force) is columns of rising air. During
sunny days, radiation from the sun heats the surface of the
earth which, in turn, heats the air in contact with it. The
heating of the air is conditioned by the nature of the
underlying surface. By buoyancy, the warmer air rises with
respect to the cooler air. The regions of rising air areORIGINAL Rk,C^:7 -
107 	OF POOR QUAUT
called thermals. Once a pilot finds a thermal, he usually
tries to circle in it to gain altitude.
When the wind blows on a mountain ridge, it is deflected
upwards. By flying in a direction generally parallel to the
ridge, on its upwind side, the pilot can remain at about
constant altitude for as long as the ridge is uninterrupted,
provided it is reasonably straight. This is called ridge
soaring. The maximum altitude achievable in ridge lift is
only a few hundred meters over the mountain.
When a mass of air flows across a mountain top, a system
of standing waves may develop downwind from the ridge.
Regions of rising and descending air alternate. Those
regions may extend very high in altitude, up to ten times
the height of the ridge. This source of lift is always used
to establish altitude records. 	This type of flying is
referred to as wave soaring.
From this very brief discussion of soaring, it is clear
that a sailplane may be flown at quite different flight
regimes. Therefore, it is difficult to define a performance
index for the design of a sailplane without making some
assumptions as to the type of soaring it will be used for.
In this work, we will design the sailplane for thermal
soaring.

A.3.2	The Cross-Country Speed
To cover a given distance, a pilot alternates slow circling
flight in thermals with fairly fast glides between thermals.
A portion of such a flight is sketched on Fig. 12. It
includes a glide in a region of air descending at constant
speed with' The sailplane flies at horizontal speed V, its
rate of sink with respect to the surrounding air is v s, it
covers the distance d in a time t 1, losing height h. The
sailplane then reaches a thermal assumed to have the shape
of a vertical cylinder. The pilot begins circling flight,
and the height h is recovered in the thermal in a time t2.
The rate of climb in the thermal is obtained by combining
the sailplane rate of sink in circling flight v sc with the
rate of climb of the thermal air wi th which is assumed to
depend on the distance r between the sailplane and the
thermal axis,
vc = vth(r)-vsc	(A.19)
The cross-country speed is defined as the distance covered
divided by the time required to reach the thermal and
recover the altitude lost.

so that
Vcc = Vvc/(with+vc+vs)	(A.22)
The concept of cross-country speed was first introduced by
K. Temmes (Ref. 30). It has been the starting point for a
large number of investigations in the areas of sailplane
design and flight strategy (see Refs. 31-33 for example).
A.3.3	Flight Strategy
Aside from keeping his sailplane as aerodynamically clean as
possible, there are three major actions that a sailplane
pilot may take to improve his cross-country speed for given
atmospheric conditions.
i)Achieve the best rate of climb in the thermal.
Intuitively, the best value of V cc will be obtained
with the best rate of climb in thermals v 	Thec
pilot must carefully select his position in the
thermal to obtain the best possible lift.
ii)Select the best interthermal speed. 	From the
development on the speed polar (Eq. A.9), we know111
that the rate of sink in straight flight v s is
directly related to the horizontal flight speed V.
For a given interthermal downdraft vith and a given
anticipated achieved rate of climb, the pilot is
left with the choice of the horizontal speed.
Intuitively, if the next thermal is expected to be
strong, the pilot should dive toward it at high
speed. This may cause him to lose a lot of
altitude in interthermal flight, but that loss will
be recovered quickly in the strong thermal, and the
cross-country speed will be high. Alternatively,
if the pilot anticipates a weak thermal, he should
choose a slow speed in interthermal flight.
Adjust the sailplane weight. To increase the
weight of a sailplane alters its speed polar in
such a way that a given rate of sink occurs at a
higher horizontal flight speed. This is favorable
in interthermal flight. However, the price to pay
for that is a lower achievable rate of climb in a
given thermal. It turns out that heavy weight is
advantageous in typical strong thermal conditions
but disadvantageous in typical weak conditions.
Therefore, sailplanes are equipped with water tanks
(water ballasts) in the wings. 	The pilot may112 	 apryja ''' !AL 'P° - G IS
OF POOR QUALITY
select the amount of water to carry on the basis of
the thermal conditions for the flight.
In the next two subsections, we will discuss how to
evaluate the best achievable rate of climb for a sailplane
in a given thermal and the best cross-country speed for
fixed rate of climb and interthermal downdraft.
A.4	BEST RATE OF CLIMB IN THERMAL FLIGHT
A.4.1	Thermal Model
A difficulty in any study of sailplane performance is the
choice of the thermal model. We will follow Carmichael
(Ref. 31) and assume the thermals to be cylinders with
vertical axes. 	The distribution of vertical airspeed is

AERODYNAMIC SUBPROBLEM
The objective of the aerodynamic subproblem is to design the
wing so as to obtain the aerodynamic characteristics
requested by the performance subproblem. These
characteristics are the wing area, the coefficients of the
drag polar, and the maximum sailplane lift coefficient. The
design is subjected to the constraint that stall must begin
at an inboard station of the wing so as to preserve lateral
control in high angle of attack conditions. The variables
of this subproblem are coefficients of the spanwise
distributions of wing chord, thickness and geometric twist.
The calculations of the contribution of the wing to the
aerodynamic characteristics will be performed using accurate
prediction methods since the wing design is the object of
this subproblem. In particular, finite span and Reynolds
number effects will be accounted for while estimating wing
lift and drag (as suggested in 34). However, the wing will
be assumed rigid, neglecting aeroelastic lift redistribution
and similar phenomena. The effect of the remaining
sailplane components on the aerodynamic characteristics of
interest will be found using more approximate methods. This
will enable us to keep the computational cost to a minimum

parameters.

for estimating the position of the wing station where stall

In the past thirty years, sailplane wings have been built
with specially tailored, laminar-flow airfoils (see Ref.
35). However, for this application, we will use airfoils
from the NACA 6-series, a class typical of immediate post
World War II sailplane design. This choice was conditioned
by the availability of experimental data. 	The specific127	OR9atNAL PAGE `5
OF POOR QUALITY
airfoil family chosen is the NACA 64-4XX which is
extensively described in Ref. 36. For the purpose of this
application, linear regressions were developed from the data
collected in Ref. 36. These laws relate the airfoil
performance characteristics to their thickness ratio (t/c)
and the Reynolds number based on the chord (Re=Vc/v). The
data from Ref. 36 is valid for the following ranges of
thickness ratio and Reynolds number
09<t/c<.18 and 630000<Re<6300000	(B.8)
Typical Reynolds number for sailplanes may be as low as
400000; therefore, the laws are somewhat deficient.
However, no sufficient set of data was found for Reynolds
numbers less than 630000.

developed in Refs. 37 and 38 where it is said to be
applicable to straight, high aspect ratio wings in
imcompressible flow. Several solution schemes exist for
Prandtl's equation. We will use Glauert's method, which is
based on Fourier series.
A new coordinate is defined along the wing by
m = cos - 1(y/b)	 (B.15)
where the angle 0 varies between 0 at the wing tip and n/2
at the wing root. Stations are chosen along the semispan at

The information obtained in the previous sections may be
used to estimate approximately the sailplane maximum lift
coefficient.
The	three-dimensional 	distribution 	of	wing	lift
coefficient is given by Eq. B.21. Assuming that stall
occurs in a given wing section when that section lift
coefficient equals its maximum local lift coefficient
obtained from experimental data (Eq. B.9), we may define the
fuselage angle of attack for which stall occurs in section y
as
afs(y) = lclmax(y)-clo(y))/c^la(y)	 (B.36)
The wing section where stall initiates (at spanwise station
ys) is such that a fs(y) is minimum. It may be determined by
numerical minimization of a fs(y) with respect to y. The
resulting angle of attack may be used with Eq. B.25 to
determine the maximum sailplane lift coefficient CLmax'
This approach is described in Ref. 39. 	The cla(y)'
clo(y) and clmax(y) distributions are Reynolds number
dependent, as was pointed out earlier. 	Therefore, the
procedure should be repeated iteratively. Such a refinement
does not seem appropriate in view of the approximate

In this subsection, we develop expressions for the vortex

the total wing drag.
The local vortex induced drag coefficient is given in
Ref. 38 as
cdi(Y) = cl(Y)[a(Y)-c1(Y)/cla(Y)] 	 (B.37)
where the () emphasizes the fact that the vortex induced
drag coefficient c di and the lift coefficient c l include
finite span effects. Now, from Fig. 14

The total drag distribution on the wing is

where the local airfoil profile drag coefficient c dp is
known once the local lift coefficient c l, the local
Reynolds number and the local thickness ratio are known, as

B.4.2.5	Miscellaneous Drag Contributions
A sailplane is aerodynamically clean in design. The only
drag contribution that will be considered in addition to
those already mentioned is that due to the gaps of the flaps

trailing edge of the wing and the vertical tailplane, we
have:

The various contributions were obtained in the two previous
subsections.
To evaluate the drag polar (Subsec. A.2.1) for known
weight and geometry, we proceed as follows.
i)	
	Choose a lift coefficient value and determine an
approximate flight speed by equating the lift to
the known weight (Eq. A.8). At this point, the
local Reynolds number is known for all sailplane

fuselage angle of attack o f is still unknown at
this step.
iii)Calculate all the terms in the sailplane trimmed

V)	Continue with the calculations of the various drag

The drag polar is obtained point by point by repeating
this procedure for different lift coefficients. In this
application, the curve is modeled by a parabola; therefore,
the process must be repeated only three times to obtain the
coefficients in Eq. A.1.

When performing the detailed structural design, the wing is
modelled by n  cylindrical elements of equal length and
constant geometric and structural properties. The element
properties are chosen to be those of their middle section in
the actual wing. Three shape parameters must be known for
the analysis of any one element. They are given for element

GLOBAL STRUCTURAL SUBPROBLEM
The global structural subproblem objective is to design the
wing structure so as to achieve the total sailplane weight
specified in the performance subproblem. Once a weight is
chosen for the sailplane fuselage, tailplane, equipment and
pilot, the available weight for structural and non-
structural wing elements is known. The design variables of
this subproblem are the coefficients in the spanwise
distributions of weight and flexural 	and torsional
stiffnesses. The optimization is subjected to the
constraints that the wing tip deflection is limited in high
speed straight flight and that the torsional divergence
speed is beyond a set limit.
The wing shape and aerodynamic load parameters are
obtained from the aerodynamic subproblem. The wing flexural
and torsional responses are investigated using Rayleigh-Ritz
analyses. The redistribution of aerodynamic forces due to
the wing elastic deformations is neglected.
Optimization and sensitivity analysis require that
derivatives of the wing weight, tip displacement and
divergence dynamic pressure be calculated with respect to
the subproblem variables and parameters. Unless otherwise

C.2 GLOBAL STRUCTURAL LEVEL WING MODEL
C.2.1	Model Description
To study the wing behavior at the global structural level,
we model it as a straight beam aligned with the previously
defined spanwise axis Y. We consider only two types of wing
deformations.164 	ORIGINAL PAGE 13
OF POOR QUAL6W
i)Bending deformations in a direction normal to the
wing mean aerodynamic chord, or, along axis N
defined in Subsec. B.5.3.
ii)Twisting deformations about the spanwise axis Y.
This neglects chordwise bending.
The parameters necessary to the description of the wing
global structural behavior are the distributions of bending
stiffness EI(y), torsional stiffness GJ(y) and total wing
weight (structural and non-structural) per unit length w(y).
It must be noted that the wing is made of composite material
as detailed in App. D. However the lay-ups are chosen so
that no bending-torsion coupling exists. Therefore, the
parameters retained will be adequate.
The distributions will be written as follows

These expressions are interpolations based on Lagrangian
polynomials (see Ref. 41). The EI i, GJi and w  are
stiffnesses and weight values at selected, equally spaced
stations y i along the wing. They are the design variables
of the global structural subproblem. They are collected in
vector X  and will be referred to as global stiffnesses.
C.2.2	Elastic Axis and Center of Gravitv Position
The structural model described in the previous subsection is
such that the elastic axis is assumed to lie on the spanwise
axis Y. Clearly, the elastic axis position depends directly
on the detailed wing design; it should be treated as a
reverse control (see Chap. 3). However, this control will
be ignored in a first approach to the design. It turns out
that this is probably a very reasonable assumption,
considering the detailed structural lay-out chosen (see App.
D).ORIGINAL 6 AGI i I::
166 	 OF POOR QUALITY
The position of a section center of gravity must be known
to properly account for the inertia forces. This is also a
reverse control. Initially, the mass center of gravity of a
wing section will be assumed at the area center of gravity
of that section, that is, at distances be from the section
leading edge and nc above the reference chord (see Subsec.
B.2.2).

C.3	STRUCTURAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
In order to obtain certification of an airplane by the
appropriate authorities, one must insure that the structure
is capable of withstanding a number of predetermined loading
conditions. Also, static and dynamic instabilities should
not occur within the flight envelope. Reference 40
describes the requirements set by the Federal Aviation
Agency (FAA) on sailplane designs. These requirements cover
stresses in load cases corresponding to symmetric or non-
symmetric flight conditions, towed flight and landing. Some
requirements also cover flutter. In addition to satisfying
the conditions set by the relevant regulating agency, the
designer may have to investigate loading conditions specific
to his own design. Clearly, a vast amount of calculation is168
required in the structural design phase of a project. While
modern optimization methods are perfectly capable of
handling multiple design conditions, it is preferable to
design the structure for a limited number of appropriately
selected load cases and instability modes. The resulting
design may then be checked for the remaining conditions and
optimization may be performed again with additional load
cases and instability modes, if desired.
In this work, the structure will be designed to satisfy
the three requirements described below.
i)Requirement 	1:	limit	out-of-plane 	bending.
Sailplane wings are typically long and flexible.
Excessive bending flexibility may result in control
surface jamming, inappropriate ground clearance
during landing or unsatisfactory dynamic behavior.
We therefore require that the wing tip deflection
be below a maximum limit utmax at an indicated
airspeed V t = 85 m/s, and a wing load factor nNw
1. Since the wing does not present bending-torsion
coupling, the constraint will control bending
stiffness and weight distributions.
ii)Requirement 2: limit stresses and preclude local
instabilities. 	To	size the details of the
structure (see App. D), we require that no failure169
occurs at a flight condition defined by n Nw = 5.33,
Vt = 100. m/s. This corresponds to a pull-up at
maximum authorized dive speed. This is a design
condition, therefore; an ultimate safety factor S 
= 1.5 must be used when calculating the ultimate
loads.
iii) Requirement 3: 	limit wing divergence dynamic
pressure. The FAA specifies that the sailplane
must be demonstrated "free of undesirable flight
characteristics for speeds below the dive speed"
(Vd). The maximum authorized dive speed for this
type of sailplane is about V  = 100 m/s. We
require that the wing divergence speed V D be such
that VD > 120. m/s. For straight wings with no
bending-torsion coupling, divergence is torsional
in nature. This constraint will therefore control
the torsional stiffness distribution.
C.4	WING TIP DEFLECTION CALCULATION

structural subproblem since it is communicated from the
aerodynamic subproblem in vector H (see Fig. 4 and Subsec.

The wing bending model is a cantilever beam of varying
bending stiffness EI(y) (Eq. C.1) under varying transverse

terms of the non-dimensional spanwise coordinate n=y/b as

The shape of the assumed mode will be taken as the

The mode shape u (n) in Eq. C.11 will be used together with
Eq. C.8 to calculate the displacement of the wing tip.
In order to carry out these calculations, we need to
estimate the parameters a and 5 for the model beam.175 	 OR'CINAL PAGE ES

Therefore, parameter ^ is obtained by requiring that the
actual distribution of stiffness EI(n) and the linear EI1(n)
have equal end values. This permits one to avoid negative
stiffnesses, as the end stiffnesses EI(0) and EI(1) are
design variables at the global structural level. They can

the wing flexibility is taken into account, the section

LOCAL STRUCTURAL SUBPROBLEM
The task of the local structural subproblem is to find the
detailed design of the wing which corresponds to the
spanwise distributions of weight and stiffnesses chosen in
the global structural subproblem. The optimization is
subjected to the additional constraints that the stresses at
selected points in the structure do not exceed appropriate
allowables and that the various wing components be free of
buckling.
The wing is divided into equal length cylindrical
elements, each of which is optimized separately. The
overall element dimensions (length, chord, thickness) are
fixed by the aerodynamic subproblem. The global structural
subproblem imposes target values for the constant weight per
unit length and flexural and torsional stiffnesses. It also
supplies values for the out-of-plane shear force, bending
and twisting moments at the inboard section of the element
for stresses and stability calculations. The design
variables of the local structural subproblem are the
detailed element dimensions. The stresses and the panel
buckling loads are found using conventional design methods.

D.2	LOCAL STRUCTURAL LEVEL WING MODEL
D.2.1	Wing Construction
The wing construction is typical of present day technology
(see Refs. 42-43). It is a shell reinforced by a straight
spar normal to the plane of symmetry of the sailplane (Fig.
21). The spar caps are built of carbon fibers oriented
spanwise and resist most of the bending moment. The shells
as well as the spar webs are of symmetric sandwich made of
fiberglass face sheets with foam core. The glass fibers are
oriented at ± 45 0 with respect to the spanwise direction,
thereby providing high shear stiffness.
Control surfaces (flaps/airbrake and aileron) run the
whole length of the trailing edge so that only the portion
of the wing between the leading edge and the rear web, the
torsion box, is capable of carrying load. Finally,
fiberglass ribs are positioned chordwise to increase the
buckling loads of the spar caps and the sandwich panels; the
rib thicknesses wild be held constant during optimization.188

D.2.2	Model Description
To conduct the design at the local level, we divide the
torsion box into n  equal length, cylindrical elements (Fig.
22). The chord length c, 4 and the maximum section thickness
t of each element are constant; together with the element
length b they are communicated to the local structural
subproblem from the aerodynamic subproblem in the vector H.i
(see Subsec. B.5.2). For each element, the design variables
are the spar cap width a and thickness t c, the leading and
trailing edge total thickness i s and face sheet thickness
tfs, the front and rear spar web total thickness t  and face
sheet thickness t fw, and the rib spacing d. Note that,
technically, the thicknesses of the composite lay-ups vary
in a discrete fashion since integer numbers of plies must be
used. Similarly, the rib spacing is a discrete quantity.
However, these will be treated as continuous variables to
avoid difficulties while optimizing the design.

The carbon fiber spar caps are about twenty times stiffer in
the spanwise direction than the fiberglass shells (Ref. 42)_
It is therefore legitimate to assume that the entire bending
moment is resisted by these spar caps. Furthermore, they
are symmetric and their thickness is small with respect to
the distance that separates them. Therefore, we assume them
to be subjected to a constant normal load per unit length

Shear forces and twisting moments induce shear flows in the
panels constituting the wing section. Simple equilibrium
arguments (see Ref. 44) show that the shear flows are
constant on panels not subjected to normal edge loads and
linear on panels subjected to constant normal edge loads.N3192

Therefore, as summarized on Fig. 23, constant shear flows
exist on the leading edge shell (N 2), the trailing edge
shell (N 3), the front spar web (N 4) and the rear spar web
(N5). The shear flows vary linearly between N 6 and N 6 on
the upper spar cap and between N 7 and N 7 on the lower one.
Four relationships may be written which express shear
flow conservation at the junctions of the various panels,

Because we consider the shear force acting normal to the
wing plane, we are only interested in the chordwise position
of the elastic axis. It is found by stating that the sum of
the torques induced about any point of the section by the
shear flows of Eq. D.11 is exactly equivalent to the torque
caused by the shear force itself (see Ref. 44). Therefore,

D.5	CALCULATION OF STRESSES
D.S.1	General Procedure
The different fiber reinforced laminated panels constituting
the wing torsion box are of symmetric lay-ups. Furthermore,
they are assumed to be loaded by in-plane edge loads.
Therefore, their deformations entail only in-plane strains.

Eqs. D.26-27, together with Eqs. D.29-30. They are in
material axes for the carbon fiber layers; for the
fiberglass layers, however, transformation D.28 must still
be used.
D.S.3	Stresses in the Sandwich Panels
A uniform state of stress exists in the sandwich panels
constituting the leading and trailing edge shells, as well
as the spar webs (see Fig. 23). 	Hence, the stresses need
only be monitored at the four points mentioned in Table 3213
(points 9 through 12). The sandwich core will be assumed
non-structural. In this case, the calculations of Subsec.
D.5.1 may be carried out quite simply. For the leading and
trailing edge shells, we have, in material axes

while for the spar webs, t f s in Eq. D.31 should be replaced
by tfw
D.5.4	Failure Criterion
The states of stress described in the two previous
subsections are two-dimensional. Therefore, a failure
criterion must be used to determine whether a given loading
induces failure. Tsai-Wu's criterion reads (Ref. 45)6
al(01+XC-XT)+02(02+YC-YT)-	a102	+T12-1 <_ 0	(D.32)

where X  and X T are the material compressive and tensile
strengths along the fibers, Y  and Y T the corresponding
quantities across the fibers and S the in-plane shear
6 General formulations for Tsai-Wu's criterion usually
involve a strength biaxial tension test. Such a stress is	
difficult to determine accurately. 	In the formulation
chosen here, the need for that strength is alleviated by
specifying that Tsai-Wu's criterion reduces to Von Mise's
yield criterion when applied to an isotropic material.

strength. Failure will not occur in the wing section if
inequality D.32 is satisfied at all points defined in Table
3; there are twelve such conditions.
D.6	SECTION STABILITY
The stability of the wing box will be ascertained by
verifying the stability of each individual component. The
leading edge shell, which exhibits a strong curvature, will
be replaced by two flat panels. because of the model cross-
section symmetry and the nature of the system of induced
loads (Fig. 23), only seven panels need be considered; they
are numbered as shown on Fig. 28. Two different buckling
problems must be solved:
i)Buckling of orthotropic sandwich panels under in-
plane shear (panels 1 through S).
ii)Buckling of orthotropic composite panels under in-
plane compression and shear (spar caps, panels 6
and 7).
These problems are discussed in the following subsections.
D.6.1	Sandwich Panels Bucklin
The sandwich panels constituting the wing torsion box are
primarily loaded in shear. This subsection is concerned

The kinematic viscosity of air is v = 1.4607 10 -5 m2/sec
(standard day, sea level). 	The wing angle of attack is
taken as i w = .0349 rad (2 0).	The following sailplane
parameters were mostly estimated from sketches of the Nimbus
II sailplane in the references to App. A. 	The sailplane
fuselage is characterized by a radius b f = 0.4 m, a maximum

height h f = 0.8 m, 	a total length I f = 7.5 m, a maximum
cross-sectional area A c = 0.6 m 2, a wetted area Sfwet = 10.0
m2, a planform area S  = 3.0 m 2, a distance nose-wing Ifn
2.0 m, a total volume V f = 1.3 m 3, a distance between wing
and horizontal tailplane 1  = 5.0 m, the wing planform area
inside the fuselage is S fw = 0.6 m 2. Reference 39 (Chap.
IX) recommends a static stability margin (x n-xcg)/c = .05.
The horizontal tailplane has a planform area S  = 1.2 m 2, an
average chord c h = 0.3 m, an aspect ratio A  = 5.0, a taper
ratio X  = 0.5, a thickness ratio (t/c) h = 0.1, a vertical
distance between wing and tailplane h 	= 1.2 m. 	The
vertical tailplane has a planform area S  = 2.4 m 2, an
average chord c  = 0.5 m, a thickness ratio (t/c) v = 0.1.
The two-level subproblem is solved using a fixed total
sailplane weight W = 4000. N for the aerodynamic
calculations; the wing is assumed untwisted (Eb = t = 0),
the planform is described by b = 10.0 m, b b = 5.0 m, c  =
1.0 m, c  = 0.7 m, and c t = 0.3 m. 	The Fourier series
analysis for spanwise distributions of lift and drag is
based on n  = 5 control points; while the aerodynamic
parameters transmitted to the global structural subproblem
(Subsec. B.5.4) involves 6 control points (n f = 5).226

In addition to the parameters related to the structural
design Requirements and given in Sec. C.3, it is specified
that the tip displacement never exceed 0.7 m. The weight
for the sailplane without wings is W nw = 2000. N. The
discretization of the distributions of weight per unit
length and bending and torsional stiffnesses are based on n 
= 5 intervals. The following side constraints are used 1.0

The foam used as core for the sandwich panels is
described by C  = 4.0 10 6 N/m2, p  = 5.89 10 2 N/m3. The
wing ribs are constructed of a 5.0 mm thick foam core with
two fiberglass face sheets of 1.0 mm each, for a total
weight per unit area p r = 36.3 N/m 2. The ratio between non-
structural and structural wing element weight is v = O.S.

DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTILEVEL OPTIMIZATION APPROACH TO THE DESIGN
OF MODERN ENGINEERING SYSTEMS
by
Jean-Francois Marie Barthelemy
(ABSTRACT)
This work describes an optimization approach to the design
of complex engineering systems. The approach assumes a
decomposition of the original problem (design of the system)
into smaller subproblems (design of subsystems) organized in
a multilevel hierarchy. As one goes down the levels, the
details of the system become more precisely defined;
furthermore, each subproblem may control the design of lower
level subproblems.
A general algorithm is proposed which carries out the
design process iteratively, starting at the top of the
hierarchy and proceeding downward. Each subproblem is
optimized separately for fixed controls from higher level
subproblems. 	An optimum sensitivity analysis is then
performed which determines the sensitivity of the subproblem

design to changes in higher level subproblem controls. The
resulting sensitivity derivatives are used to construct
constraints which force the controlling subproblems into
chosing their own designs so as to improve the lower level
subproblem designs while satisfying their own constraints.
The applicability of the proposed algorithm is
demonstrated by devising a four-level hierarchy to perform
the simultaneous aerodynamic and structural design_ of a
high-performance sailplane wing for maximum cross-country
speed.	The levels are devoted successively to selecting
global	performance parameters, 	determining 	the wing
aerodynamic shape, defining the spanwise distributions of
global structural characteristics, 	and, performing the
detailed design of wing substructures.
Finally, the concepts discussed are applied to the two-
level minimum weight structural design of the sailplane
wing. The numerical experiments show that discontinuities
in the sensitivity derivatives may delay convergence, but
that the algorithm is robust enough to overcome these
discontinuities and produce low-weight feasible designs,
regardless of whether the optimization is started from the
feasible space or the infeasible one.

INTRODUCTION
The design of modern engineering systems is a procedure
which often integrates different disciplines and always
involves a large number of variables. While optimization
techniques provide an attractive formal tool for carrying
out the design process, a weakness of these techniques
remains in their inability to handle 	truly large
multidisciplinary design problems. 	To overcome that
weakness, designers must resort to some sort of
decomposition method. The original design problem is broken
down into smaller subproblems which are then optimized
separately. However, these subproblems are generally
coupled so that an iterative scheme must be devised which
coordinates their optimization in order that the resulting
design is, to some extent, optimum with respect to the
original problem.
1.1	OVERVIEW OF EXISTING LITERATURE
Several studies have been devoted to decomposition of large
optimization problems. These studies pertain to all the
areas of engineering as well as economics and management.
The following overview focuses mainly on structuralOF POOR 	 eW
optimization. For the sake of the discussion, two classes
of decomposition methods are defined: formal methods and
intuitive methods. In formal methods, the mathematical
structure of the problem is exploited to arrive at a rigid
decomposition scheme. Consequently, a rigorous framework
exists within which the mathematical properties of the
method may be assessed. In intuitive methods, understanding
of the behavior of the physical system considered is
apparently the prime factor directing the decomposition.
These methods are sometimes referred to as rational methods
and their mathematical characteristics can seldom be studied
in great detail. An intuitive approach provides, of course,
the only option for decomposing those problems which do not
possess the structure for which a formal decomposition
method exists. This division into formal and intuitive
methods is somewhat arbitrary as a given approach may very
well be shown to belong to both classes; however,it
facilitates the discussion.
1.1.1	Formal Decomposition Methods
A very extensive body of work exists on decomposition in
linear programming (LP). The existence of truly large
problems in the fields of economics and operations research
has stimulated efforts aiming at exploiting the specialOF, POOR ft:{rv^ a ^}^^
structures of the constraint matrix. The major initial step
in that area seems to have been the introduction of the
Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle in 1960. By 1970 the
developments in this active field were so numerous as to
warrant the publication of a textbook by Lasdon (Ref. 1).
In the area of structural design, problems involving
collapse design of trusses and frames were solved
successfully using the LP decomposition techniques (Refs.
2-5).
Dynamic programming (DP) was discussed by Bellman as
early as 1957 (Ref. 6). 	It is a decomposition method
suitable for nonlinear problems. The problems must be
serial, that is, of the form such that any change in the
design of one subproblem affects only those subproblems that
are	"downstream" 	in	the	decision-making 	process.
Furthermore, the problem objective function must be
additive. However, DP cannot easily handle constraints that
involve more than one subproblem. Also, it becomes very
expensive if there are large amounts of data transmitted
between successive subproblems. Among the advantages of the
DP method are its capability to generate global optimum
designs and to handle discrete variables and discontinuous
functions. In structural design, dynamic programming seems
to find use in optimization of "one-dimensional" structures,OF POOR QU ? €TV
N
that is, beams, one-bay multistory or one-story multibay
frames, and transmission towers (see Ref. 7 Chap. XI or Ref.
8).
Optimization algorithms were devised for separable
nonlinear problems using coordination techniques developed
in the context of multilevel decision-making processes.
Once a problem has been decomposed into smaller subproblems,
the main task is to coordinate the design of the different
subproblems. Essentially, the subproblems are grouped on
the lower level of a hierarchy and an additional higher
level subproblem is added whose role is to select the values
of coordinating variables so as to force the other
subproblems into choosing designs corresponding to improved
overall problem performance. The coordinating subproblem is
itself cast in the form of an optimization problem. As the
evaluation of the objective function of the coordinating
subproblem requires complete optimization of all lower level
subproblems, this type of algorithm may turn out to be very
expensive. A study of coordination in hierarchical systems
is given in the 1970 monograph by Mesarovic and coauthors
(Ref. 9). Kirsch and coworkers have used both the model
coordination technique and the goal coordination technique
to solve various structural design problems (Ref. 7 Chap. X
and Refs. 10-12)1.1.2	Intuitive Decomposition Methods
The first attempts at developing intuitive decomposition
schemes for large structural design problems were extensions
of the fully stressed design method. In these approaches
the structure is seen as a combination of elements
(substructures). 	Given an initial design for all the
elements, an analysis of the structure is made to determine
inter-element forces. 	Then, each element is optimized
separately on the assumption that changes in that element
design do not change inter-element forces. Once all the
elements have ,been designed, the structure is analyzed again
and the process repeated until convergence is achieved.
Giles (Ref. 13) and Sobieski (Ref. 14) performed the design
of airplane wings under constraints on stresses and element
stability using that approach. Kirsch and coworkers (Ref.
15) designed frameworks using a similar approach but
reanalyzing 	the	structure 	after	each	substructure
optimization, 	in order to account better for load
redistribution.
When optimizing a structure one substructure at a time,
it is difficult to handle global constraints, that is, those
constraints affected by variables belonging to more than one
substructure. In Ref. 16, Sobieski and Loendorf designed
airplane fuselages under local constraints on stresses and6
OF P'^JCR
local instabilities and global constraints on fuselage
elastic displacements. The optimization was first carried
out with the local constraints, as described above. If
necessary, the resulting design was subsequently modified to
satisfy the displacement constraints using a unit load
method to determine the impact that changes in element
design have on the violated displacements. Another example
of treatment of global constraints is given by Hughes and
coworkers (Ref. 17) who designed ship compartments for
minimum cost under constraints on stresses.
A generalized fully stressed design approach to large
problems is certainly economically appealing. However, it
presents two difficulties. As pointed out in Ref. 14
"...minimization of the individual component masses does not
guarantee minimization of the total mass This situation
is caused by the inability to control the load path on the
assembled structure level... ." As mentioned earlier also,
it makes it difficult to handle global constraints. 	In
Refs. 18 and 19 Schmit and coworkers used a two-level
approach to design trusses and aircraft wings. At the
global level, the distributions of stiffnesses, the global
level variables, were chosen so as to minimize the total
structural weight, while satisfying global displacement
constraints and also some local constraints on stresses andORIGINA L PAGE @S 	7
OF POOR QUALITY
structural element buckling. For known stiffnesses, the end
forces on the various structural elements were calculated.
At the local level, these structural elements were optimized
separately with respect to their detail design, the local
level variables, so that the changes in element stiffnesses
were minimized, while the local constraints were still
satisfied. The process was repeated until convergence was
achieved. In this decomposition, the introduction of the
global level problem was a key factor in overcoming both
difficulties . attributed to the generalized fully stressed
design approach. By placing the minimization of the weight
at the global level, the opportunity was kept to trade
structural mass between the elements in order to improve the
load paths while reducing the total weight. 	Also, the
provision was left to explicitly handle global constraints.
1.1.3	General Approach to Engineering System Design
The intuitive decomposition methods discussed to this point
are very specific and cannot easily be extended to different
classes of problems. In particular, they are not suited for
multidisciplinary problems. In Ref. 20, Sobieski proposed a
general approach to the design of large engineering systems,
and in Ref. 21, he proceeded to demonstrate the proposed
concepts by applying them to the two-level minimum weight8	 ORIGINAL RAGE IS
OF POOR QUALITY
design of a portal framework under local constraints on
stresses and local buckling and global constraints on
displacement. At the global level, the weight of the
framework is minimized with respect to the cross-sectional
area and bending moment of inertia of the different beams,
while satisfying constraints on displacements. Once a
global design is obtained, the framework is analyzed to
obtain the end loads on the beams. At the local level, each
beam is designed separately. Its detailed dimensions are
proportioned so as achieve the values of cross-sectional
area and bending moment of inertia chosen at the global
level while satisfying constraints on stresses and local
buckling. 	This is done by minimizing a measure of the
violation of the subproblem constraints. An optimum
sensitivity analysis (Ref. 22) is then performed in order to
obtain a linear approximation to the constraint violation of
each local level subproblem in terms of the global level
variables. The whole optimization is repeated, but, at the
global level, it is required that the (linearized) local
level constraint violations be reduced. This iterative
process is pursued until all the local and global level
constraints are satisfied and the framework weight cannot be
reduced further. Although the proposed scheme is applied to
a structural synthesis problem, it is applicable to any typeOt;i 	 L	r,	
9
OF POOP QUALITY
of engineering design. Furthermore, it may be used with
decompositions involving more than two levels. Some of the
key features of the approach are discussed below.
The method postulates a multilevel decomposition of the
problem, that is, a decomposition where the different
subproblems are grouped on the levels of a hierarchy. The
subproblem at the top level is concerned with the
optimization of the overall system objective in terms of
design variables describing that system in very global
terms. As one proceeds down the hierarchy, the subproblems
are dealing wi~h subsystems described in deeper and deeper
levels of detail. The choice of the specifics of the
decomposition for a given application still remains largely
a matter of physical insight and convenience.
Below the highest level, each subproblem is concerned
with finding a set of design variables which satisfy its own
constraints for fixed values of higher level variables. It
turns out that this amounts to finding a design vector which
satisfies a set of equality constraints and a set of
inequality constraints. Such a mathematical problem may not
have a solution. It may be transformed into a mathematical
programming problem which maximizes a measure of "how well"
the design satisfies the sets of constraints. The
subproblem formulation of Ref. 21 uses the equality10
ORIGINAL PAGE 19
OF POOR QUALITY
constraints to eliminate dependent variables and forms a
penalty function with the inequality constraints. That
penalty function is a measure of constraint violation which
is then minimized with respect to the independent variables
to find that design which best meets the constraints.
Once designs are obtained for all the subproblems on a
given level, sensitivity analyses are performed to determine
the effect changes in higher level variables have on lower
level constraint violations. The resulting sensitivity
derivatives are used to construct linear approximations to
the lower subproblem constraint violations in terms of the
higher level design variables. 	These approximations are
added as constraints for the next optimization of the higher
level subproblems. This enables the optimization of the
higher level subproblems to be conducted so as to improve
the design of the lower level subproblems which have
violated constraints or so as to reduce the margin of
satisfaction for those subproblems for which all constraints
are amply satisfied. In essence, this makes the trade-offs
between the different subproblems visible and allows them to
be resolved in a rational fashion.
The task of the highest level subproblem remains the
optimization of the system performance index with respect to
its own global variables which are required not only toI= POOR QUALITY
satisfy its own constraints but also to reduce the
constraint violation for the lower level subproblems.
1.2	OUTLINE
The purpose of this work has been to investigate the
applicability of Sobieski's method to the design of complex,
multidisciplinary engineering systems. It was elected to
focus the effort on a specific example: the simultaneous
aerodynamic and structural design of a high-performance
sailplane wing for maximum cross-country speed. 	It was
determined that this design problem could be carried out by
means of a four-level decomposition. An algorithm was
developed to solve the problem and it was tested on the two
lower levels of the decomposition.
In Chapter II, we discuss the optimum sensitivity
analysis technique. We show that the stationary conditions
satisfied at a local constrained optimum may be used to
determine the sensitivity of optimum objective functions and
design variables to changes in those parameters that were
kept fixed during the optimization.
Chapter III is devoted to a detailed description of the
proposed algorithm. It is constructed along the same lines
as that described in Ref. 20. The main difference resides
with the specifics of the mathematical formulation for the12
OF pOOR QUALITY
individual subproblems. The present algorithm treats
equality constraints in a general numerical fashion.
Furthermore, it is designed as a constrained programming
problem rather than as a penalty function minimization
problem. Particular attention is paid to the potential
difficulties associated with decompositions that involve
more than two levels.
In Chapter IV, the decomposition proposed for the example
problem is detailed. It is a four-level decomposition. The
highest level subproblem entails selection of global
performance parameters which include weight and aerodynamic
characteristics. Then follows an aerodynamic subproblem
where the shape of the wing is defined so as to obtain the
aerodynamic characteristics specified in the performance
subproblem and control the initiation bf stall. On the
third level of the decomposition is a global structural
subproblem where the wing -spanwise distributions of weight
and stiffnesses are selected for fixed total weight and so
as to limit the wing bending response and torsional
divergence speed. Finally, at the lowest level, the wing is
modeled by a series of spanwise elements each of which is
designed separately for fixed weight and stiffnesses under
stress and local buckling constraints.
sl13
In Chapter V, the algorithm introduced in Chap. III is
applied to the two lower levels of the hierarchy described
in Chap. IV. The problem solved is the minimum weight
design of a straight composite wing. Results are given for
designs started from both the feasible space and the
infeasible space.
Finally, Chapter VI is devoted to synthesizing the
experience gained with this work and making recommendations
for continued investigation.OF POOR QJHLi d V

SUMMARY OF PERTINENT RESULTS FROM OPTIMUM
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Optimum sensitivity analysis is a technique which permits
one to investigate the sensitivity of the solution of an
optimization problem to variations in the parameters of the
problem. It yields derivatives of the optimum values of the
design variables and objective function with respect to the
parameters, derivatives which may then be used to perform
trade-off analyses. These derivatives are called
sensitivity derivatives to distinguish them from the
derivatives of objective function and constraints with
respect to the design variables which are termed behavior
derivatives. 	This technique was recently introduced by
Sobieski and coauthors (Ref. 22) as a tool for structural
synthesis. It has been specialized by Schmit and Chang
(Ref. 23) to a formulation of the problem of structural
sizing for mimimum weight based on approximation concepts
and dual methods, and has been used by Haftka (Ref.  24 ) in
the optimization of damage tolerant structures. The
elements of the technique required for the remainder of this
work are discussed in this chapter; the reader interested in
a more general discussion should consult Ref. 22.

The optimum sensitivity derivative of the objective function

where subscript p indicates partial derivatives with respect
to vector P. Now, we can show that F' may be found without
actually calculating X'. We require that the optimum point

values to n-m a components of each column of Y and deduce the
remaining m a components from Eq. 2.11. In general, Y
differs from the true sensitivity derivatives of the
variables X' , unless n = m a. Assume that, in the space of
the design variables X, an infinitesimal perturbation of
parameter P results in a move from the initial point in the
direction specified by Y. Then, the resulting design is
still at the intersection of the originally active
constraints because condition 2.7 is enforced; however, it
may not be optimum because the first of Eqs. 2.3 may not be

The approach of Sec. 2.2 yields the exact value of F' at
considerably lower cost than that of Sec. 2.3 since it
involves only first-order partial derivatives of F and q 
with respect to the design variables and parameters of the
problem. However, it does not usually permit one to obtain
X' (unless n = m a). The choice between the two types of
analysis is very much dependent on the application
considered and the nature of the optimization problem at
hand. It must be guided by a comparison between the cost of
calculating second-order partial derivatives of F and g  on
the one hand, and the benefit of knowing the sensitivity
derivatives of the variables on the other hand.
It must be noted that higher order sensitivity
derivatives may be obtained for X F and X by setting
higher order total derivatives of the two first stationary
conditions (Eqs. 2.3) to zero. In particular, Ref. 25 shows
how little additional calculation is required to find F",
once X' has been obtained.

After solving a mathematical programming problem and

linearly independent, if one wants to obtain the Lagrange
multipliers from Eq. 2.10. The algorithm described below
was used with success.
i)Select an initial set S  of nearly satisfied
constraints by retaining those constraints whose
value is above a small negative tolerance.
ii)Identify S pa, the subset of S a which contains the
maximum number of constraints with independent
gradients. To achieve that, the constraint
gradients are taken as the columns of a rectangular
matrix and a Gaussian elimination with row and
column interchanges is performed to identify the
independent columns.
iii)Use Eq. 2.10 to find the Lagrange multipliers
corresponding to set S pa. Note that the fact that
the constraints of set Spa have independent
gradients is a guarantee that Eq. 2.10 has a
solution.
iv)Find the smallest Lagrange multiplier ai.
V)	If X. is negative (less than a small positive
tolerance), eliminate constraint i from set S  and
restart the process in ii). 	If X  is positive,
terminate the process since S'a is the desired set.22	'3F ? DR U` F_:
Note that steps ii) and iii) would not be required if QR
decomposition were used. In step v), only the constraints
with strictly positive Lagrange multipliers are kept, even
though active constraints may have Lagrange multipliers that
are zero. This is because constraints with zero Lagrange
multipliers are redundant; hence, their gradients are
linearly dependent on other constraint gradients.
In this work, the sensitivity derivatives are used to
extend optimization information over a range of variation
for the parameters of the design problems considered. This
is achieved by means of the linear extrapolations given in
Eq. 2.5. The implicit relationships 2.2 are expected to be
nonlinear, in general. Hence, the extrapolations being
first-order Taylor series expansions, they are valid only
for limited AP. Furthermore, the calculation of the
sensitivity derivatives is based on the assumption that the
set of constraints active at the initial optimum will remain
unchanged as the parameter P is changed to P+AP.
Perturbations of the parameters cause moves of the
constraint boundaries with respect to each other and,
therefore, may very well result in changes in the active
constraint set. These changes then imply reduced accuracy
of the extrapolated optima. The question arises of whether
it is possible to estimate the magnitude of the parameterOF POOR QvA° ITY
perturbations which cause changes in the active constraint
set. It was proposed in Ref. 22 that the perturbation of
parameter p (element of vector P) which results in
constraint i changing from active status to inactive status
may be obtained to the first order by stating that X  is
reduced to zero when constraint i leaves the active set,
Xi(P+APi) _ Xi(P)+Xi(P)APi = 0
or
Opi = -ai(P)/Xi(P)	(2.15)
Reference 22 likewise suggested that the perturbation of
parameter p causing constraint i to change from inactive
status to active status could be found as that value ep i for
which gi(p+Api) becomes zero.
gi(P+APi) = gi(P)+1gix(P)X'(P)1APi = 0
then
APi= -gi(P)/Igix( P)X'(P))	(2.16)
It was observed in Ref. 26 that Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 could be
unreliable. These estimates were used to determine with a
specific design problem example what parameter perturbations
cause changes in the status of the different constraints247^ "n
OF POOR QJAUTY
involved, attempting so to speak, to construct an history
of the active constraint set as p varies. This may not be
an appropriate approach. Indeed, Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 may be
used to estimate a Ap i for each of the problem constraints,
indicating when the status of a particular constraint is
supposed to change. However, only the smallest (in absolute
value) negative and positive of these dp i (Ap_ and 4p+)
should be taken into consideration. The extrapolations
based on sensitivity derivatives obtained at p should be
adequate for p+Ap - < p+pp 5 p+pp +, But any prediction
beyond that range (in particular prediction of change in the
active constraint set) should not be relied upon since it
would have been obtained with derivatives corresponding to
an inappropriate active constraint set. In essence, as
suggested in Ref. 23, the Ap i of Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 must be
regarded as bounds on Op. Barring excessive nonlinearity,
the range of ep defined by the intersection of these bounds
is that within which the extrapolations based on sensitivity
derivatives calculated at p should be reliable. 	In the
absence of changes in the active constraint set, the
accuracy of Eq. 	2.5 is limited only by the inherent
nonlinearity of the specific design problem considered.
Experiments conducted with various structural design
problems showed (Ref. 22) that linear-extrapolation-based25

estimates of optimum objective functions and design
variables fell within a few percent of actual optimization
result, for parameter variations of up to twenty percent;
the predictions often were better for the objective function
than for the design variables.(n^ niece,.

PRESENTATION OF THE ALGORITHM
This chapter is devoted to discussing an algorithm proposed
for the design of complex engineering systems. The method
is based on multilevel decomposition of the corresponding
design problems 	into	subproblems 	which	are	solved
separately. 	The algorithm is discussed in general terms.
This is done so as to avoid focusing on a particular
problem. 	The following chapter will be devoted to
investigating the applicability of the approach described
here to a specific problem. 	The abstract concepts
introduced here can be more easily put in a physical context
if this chapter and the following one are read
simultaneously. The presentation begins with a definition
of the type of multilevel decomposition considered and of
the components of that decomposition. Then, the discussion
centers on the formulation and solution of the subproblems.
Finally, the organization of the overall optimization is
discussed. 	The developments follow those by Sobieski in
Ref. 20.

The starting point of this discussion is the task of
designing a system by finding a set of variables which
optimize a performance index while satisfying a number of
constraints. This will be referred to as the
overall problem. Assume that, for convenience, the overall
problem is decomposed into a number of subproblems, each of
which corresponds to the design of a subsystem, and has its
own sets of variables and constraints. The subproblems are
organized in a hierarchy as shown on Fig. 1. The subproblem
at the top of the hierarchy is the design of the whole
system, in very general terms. The next level deals with
major subsystems, the third one with subsystems of the major
subsystems, and so on. As one goes down the levels, the
details of the system become more and more precisely
defined. The subproblems are identified by two numbers ij
which define (i) the level of the subproblem, and (j) its
position on that level. 	The level numbers increase
downward, and the subproblem numbers increase, say, from
left to right. The hierarchy is assumed to have 1 levels,
there are n  subproblems on level i.
The whole design process is conducted iteratively,
starting at the highest level and going down. 	Each
subsystem is designed separately. 	The object of the
algorithm is to coordinate the design of the different28

subsystems so as to obtain optimum system performance by
resolving the trade-offs between the subsystems in a
rational fashion. This is achieved by manipulating two
types of interactions between the subproblems: the controls
and the responses. A control is a quantity selected in a
subproblem to influence another subproblem in the hierarchy.
A response is a quantity that reflects the effect the design
of one subproblem has on that of another subproblem. In
this work, we assume that the controls flow exclusively
downward in the hierarchy, while the responses flow
exclusively upward. This excludes situations where a
subproblem controls another subproblem on the same level
(lateral control) or on a higher level (reverse control).'
As represented symbolically on Fig. 2, each subproblem is
assumed to receive controls from higher level subproblems
through vector CI ij (control inputs in subproblem if), and
to receive responses from lower level subproblems through
vector RIij (response inputs in subproblem i1). Also, each
subproblem is assumed to control lower level subproblems
with vector COij (control outputs from subproblem i^), and
' In Ref. 20, the controls are named interaction quantities.
The interested reader should refer to that source for
indications as to how to handle reverse and lateral
controls.c) Highest level subproblem.

to respond to higher level subproblems with vector ROij
(response outputs from subproblem ice). This discussion does
not make any assumption on the specific form of the
controls, except that the control outputs from a subproblem
depend on the variables of that subproblem; they may be the
variables themselves or functions of these variables (CO .j =i
Coij(Xij)). Likewise, the controls imposed on subproblem ij
(CI ij) are not specified , except that they are assumed
known once all the control outputs from higher level
subproblems (Co ri, a<i) are known. The response outputs
from a subproblem (RO ij) will be defined in this chapter.
Furthermore, it will be shown that the response inputs into
a subproblem (RI ij) are entirely known once the response
outputs from the lower level subproblems (RO as, a>i) are
known.
For each iteration of the overall system, each subproblem
is concerned with finding a design which satisfies its own
constraints for the controls specified by the higher level
subproblems (CI ij). In addition, the subproblem manipulates
its own controls (CO..) so as to improve the responses from
the lower level subproblems (RI ij ).	Mathematically, this
implies finding a design vector that satisfies a set of0"KY A p P cn- n
32	OF POOR QUALITY
equality constraints and a set of inequality constraints.
This problem may be solved by transforming it into a
nonlinear mathematical programming problem where a measure
of constraint violation is minimized with respect to the
design vector. The subproblem's own response (RO ij) is then
constituted of the minimum measure of constraint violation
as well as derivatives indicating the sensitivity of that
minimum measure to changes in the controls imposed on the
subproblem.
The subproblem on the highest level of the hierarchy
drives the whole design process. It selects its own design
variables so as to optimize the overall problem performance
index and satisfy its own constraints. It adjusts its
controls (CO 11) to improve the responses from the lower
levels (RI 11), that is, reduce the constraint violation in
the lower level subproblems.

Figure 2 a) describes symbolically subproblem lj, a
subproblem on the lowest level of the hierarchy. The vector
of design variables is X lj, the subproblem design is

The functions g lj and elj are vector-valued. The subproblem
design is subject to a set of inequality constraints (Eq.
3.1.a). These are the constraints set on the corresponding
subsystem in the statement of the overall non-decomposed
problem. The design is also subject to a set of equality
constraints (Eq. 3.1.b). Some of these may come from the
formulation of the overall non-decomposed problem; some are
imposed on the subproblem during decomposition. The
multilevel decomposition consists of different models of the
system being designed, the models becoming more refined as
one progresses down the hierarchy. The equality constraints
arise from the necessity of requiring consistency between
the models at different levels. Also, some upper and lower
bounds may be set on the variables (Eq. 3.1.c). As stated
in the previous section, the subproblem is assumed to be
controlled by each subproblem on the higher levels. As a
result, the vector of controls CI lj is functionally
dependent on the optimum designs of all the subproblems
above the lowest level.34

Problem 3.1 2 may have from zero to an infinity of
solutions, depending on the controls CI lj . We transform it
into a nonlinear mathematical programming problem by
introducing two new variables Elj and n1j which are used to
relax inequality and equality constraints. These new
variables are combined into a composite function which is a
global measure of constraint violation and which is
minimized to identify the "best" design. The transformed

where b is a positive constant. Each equality constraint is
replaced by two inequality constraints (Eq. 3.3.c). The
distance between these constraints (2n ij ) is forced to
remain positive because of Eq. 3.3.e and to decrease because
of the second term in the objective function. 	Each
inequality constraint is relaxed by the addition of variable
E: mechanism of that relaxation is described in Fig.
3, for a simple two-dimensional problem with one equality
and three inequality constraints, assuming that the equality
constraint is identically satisfied. The first term in the
objective function (Eq. 3.3.a) is defined so as to increase
Eli . A high positive value for Eli is quite acceptable as
it means that the selected design point is deep inside the
feasible domain, away from the constraint boundaries, and
that decreases the chances of obtaining infeasible designs
when the controls are perturbed. If the solution of Problem
3.3 is so that Eli z 0 and Ti lj = 0, then it solves Problem
3.1. If, on the other hand, we have Elj < 0 or Ti lj x 0,
then the resulting design is infeasible with respect to
Problem 3.1.
Constant b is added to the definition of the objective
function to control the importance attributed to violatingOF POOP: QJA i"d Y
the different constraints. A high value for b results in a
heavy penalty paid for violating equality constraints;
conversely, a low value for b makes the penalty for
violating inequality constraints more important, in relative
terms. In addition to adjusting b, it may prove appropriate
to scale variables E1j and n1j in order to make all
components of the constraint gradients of the same order of
magnitude.
Any nonlinear programming algorithm may be used to solve
Problem 3.3. 	This yields X lj, as well as a measure of
inequality constraint violation E1j and a measure of
equality constraint violation n1j. These are functionally
dependent on the controls CI 1j and, therefore, as indicated
by Eq. 3.2, on the optimum design variables of subproblems
on higher levels. Optimum sensitivity analysis may be used
to study the effect changes in higher level subproblem
variables have on the constraint violations for subproblem

DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTILEVEL OPTIMIZATION APPROACH TO THE DESIGN
OF MODERN ENGINEERING SYSTEMS
by
Jean-Francois Marie Barthelemy
(ABSTRACT)
This work describes an optimization approach to the design
of complex engineering systems. The approach assumes a
decomposition of the original problem (design of the system)
into smaller subproblems (design of subsystems) organized in
a multilevel hierarchy. As one goes down the levels, the
details of the system become more precisely defined;
furthermore, each subproblem may control the design of lower
level subproblems.
A general algorithm is proposed which carries out the
design process iteratively, starting at the top of the
hierarchy and proceeding downward. Each subproblem is
optimized separately for fixed controls from higher level
subproblems. 	An optimum sensitivity analysis is then
performed which determines the sensitivity of the subproblem
i0R1 GINAL PACE 13

design to changes in higher level subproblem controls. The
resulting sensitivity derivatives are used to construct
constraints which force the controlling subproblems into
chosing their own designs so as to improve the lower level
subproblem designs while satisfying their own constraints.
The applicability of the proposed algorithm is
demonstrated by devising a four-level hierarchy to perform
the simultaneous aerodynamic and structural design_ of a
high-performance sailplane wing for maximum cross-country
speed.	The levels are devoted successively to selecting
global	performance parameters, 	determining 	the wing
aerodynamic shape, defining the spanwise distributions of
global structural characteristics, 	and, performing the
detailed design of wing substructures.
Finally, the concepts discussed are applied to the two-
level minimum weight structural design of the sailplane
wing. The numerical experiments show that discontinuities
in the sensitivity derivatives may delay convergence, but
that the algorithm is robust enough to overcome these
discontinuities and produce low-weight feasible designs,
regardless of whether the optimization is started from the
feasible space or the infeasible one.

INTRODUCTION
The design of modern engineering systems is a procedure
which often integrates different disciplines and always
involves a large number of variables. While optimization
techniques provide an attractive formal tool for carrying
out the design process, a weakness of these techniques
remains in their inability to handle 	truly large
multidisciplinary design problems. 	To overcome that
weakness, designers must resort to some sort of
decomposition method. The original design problem is broken
down into smaller subproblems which are then optimized
separately. However, these subproblems are generally
coupled so that an iterative scheme must be devised which
coordinates their optimization in order that the resulting
design is, to some extent, optimum with respect to the
original problem.
1.1	OVERVIEW OF EXISTING LITERATURE
Several studies have been devoted to decomposition of large
optimization problems. These studies pertain to all the
areas of engineering as well as economics and management.
The following overview focuses mainly on structuralOF POOR 	 eW
optimization. For the sake of the discussion, two classes
of decomposition methods are defined: formal methods and
intuitive methods. In formal methods, the mathematical
structure of the problem is exploited to arrive at a rigid
decomposition scheme. Consequently, a rigorous framework
exists within which the mathematical properties of the
method may be assessed. In intuitive methods, understanding
of the behavior of the physical system considered is
apparently the prime factor directing the decomposition.
These methods are sometimes referred to as rational methods
and their mathematical characteristics can seldom be studied
in great detail. An intuitive approach provides, of course,
the only option for decomposing those problems which do not
possess the structure for which a formal decomposition
method exists. This division into formal and intuitive
methods is somewhat arbitrary as a given approach may very
well be shown to belong to both classes; however,it
facilitates the discussion.
1.1.1	Formal Decomposition Methods
A very extensive body of work exists on decomposition in
linear programming (LP). The existence of truly large
problems in the fields of economics and operations research
has stimulated efforts aiming at exploiting the specialOF, POOR ft:{rv^ a ^}^^
structures of the constraint matrix. The major initial step
in that area seems to have been the introduction of the
Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle in 1960. By 1970 the
developments in this active field were so numerous as to
warrant the publication of a textbook by Lasdon (Ref. 1).
In the area of structural design, problems involving
collapse design of trusses and frames were solved
successfully using the LP decomposition techniques (Refs.
2-5).
Dynamic programming (DP) was discussed by Bellman as
early as 1957 (Ref. 6). 	It is a decomposition method
suitable for nonlinear problems. The problems must be
serial, that is, of the form such that any change in the
design of one subproblem affects only those subproblems that
are	"downstream" 	in	the	decision-making 	process.
Furthermore, the problem objective function must be
additive. However, DP cannot easily handle constraints that
involve more than one subproblem. Also, it becomes very
expensive if there are large amounts of data transmitted
between successive subproblems. Among the advantages of the
DP method are its capability to generate global optimum
designs and to handle discrete variables and discontinuous
functions. In structural design, dynamic programming seems
to find use in optimization of "one-dimensional" structures,OF POOR QU ? €TV
N
that is, beams, one-bay multistory or one-story multibay
frames, and transmission towers (see Ref. 7 Chap. XI or Ref.
8).
Optimization algorithms were devised for separable
nonlinear problems using coordination techniques developed
in the context of multilevel decision-making processes.
Once a problem has been decomposed into smaller subproblems,
the main task is to coordinate the design of the different
subproblems. Essentially, the subproblems are grouped on
the lower level of a hierarchy and an additional higher
level subproblem is added whose role is to select the values
of coordinating variables so as to force the other
subproblems into choosing designs corresponding to improved
overall problem performance. The coordinating subproblem is
itself cast in the form of an optimization problem. As the
evaluation of the objective function of the coordinating
subproblem requires complete optimization of all lower level
subproblems, this type of algorithm may turn out to be very
expensive. A study of coordination in hierarchical systems
is given in the 1970 monograph by Mesarovic and coauthors
(Ref. 9). Kirsch and coworkers have used both the model
coordination technique and the goal coordination technique
to solve various structural design problems (Ref. 7 Chap. X
and Refs. 10-12)1.1.2	Intuitive Decomposition Methods
The first attempts at developing intuitive decomposition
schemes for large structural design problems were extensions
of the fully stressed design method. In these approaches
the structure is seen as a combination of elements
(substructures). 	Given an initial design for all the
elements, an analysis of the structure is made to determine
inter-element forces. 	Then, each element is optimized
separately on the assumption that changes in that element
design do not change inter-element forces. Once all the
elements have ,been designed, the structure is analyzed again
and the process repeated until convergence is achieved.
Giles (Ref. 13) and Sobieski (Ref. 14) performed the design
of airplane wings under constraints on stresses and element
stability using that approach. Kirsch and coworkers (Ref.
15) designed frameworks using a similar approach but
reanalyzing 	the	structure 	after	each	substructure
optimization, 	in order to account better for load
redistribution.
When optimizing a structure one substructure at a time,
it is difficult to handle global constraints, that is, those
constraints affected by variables belonging to more than one
substructure. In Ref. 16, Sobieski and Loendorf designed
airplane fuselages under local constraints on stresses and6
OF P'^JCR
local instabilities and global constraints on fuselage
elastic displacements. The optimization was first carried
out with the local constraints, as described above. If
necessary, the resulting design was subsequently modified to
satisfy the displacement constraints using a unit load
method to determine the impact that changes in element
design have on the violated displacements. Another example
of treatment of global constraints is given by Hughes and
coworkers (Ref. 17) who designed ship compartments for
minimum cost under constraints on stresses.
A generalized fully stressed design approach to large
problems is certainly economically appealing. However, it
presents two difficulties. As pointed out in Ref. 14
"...minimization of the individual component masses does not
guarantee minimization of the total mass This situation
is caused by the inability to control the load path on the
assembled structure level... ." As mentioned earlier also,
it makes it difficult to handle global constraints. 	In
Refs. 18 and 19 Schmit and coworkers used a two-level
approach to design trusses and aircraft wings. At the
global level, the distributions of stiffnesses, the global
level variables, were chosen so as to minimize the total
structural weight, while satisfying global displacement
constraints and also some local constraints on stresses andORIGINA L PAGE @S 	7
OF POOR QUALITY
structural element buckling. For known stiffnesses, the end
forces on the various structural elements were calculated.
At the local level, these structural elements were optimized
separately with respect to their detail design, the local
level variables, so that the changes in element stiffnesses
were minimized, while the local constraints were still
satisfied. The process was repeated until convergence was
achieved. In this decomposition, the introduction of the
global level problem was a key factor in overcoming both
difficulties . attributed to the generalized fully stressed
design approach. By placing the minimization of the weight
at the global level, the opportunity was kept to trade
structural mass between the elements in order to improve the
load paths while reducing the total weight. 	Also, the
provision was left to explicitly handle global constraints.
1.1.3	General Approach to Engineering System Design
The intuitive decomposition methods discussed to this point
are very specific and cannot easily be extended to different
classes of problems. In particular, they are not suited for
multidisciplinary problems. In Ref. 20, Sobieski proposed a
general approach to the design of large engineering systems,
and in Ref. 21, he proceeded to demonstrate the proposed
concepts by applying them to the two-level minimum weight8	 ORIGINAL RAGE IS
OF POOR QUALITY
design of a portal framework under local constraints on
stresses and local buckling and global constraints on
displacement. At the global level, the weight of the
framework is minimized with respect to the cross-sectional
area and bending moment of inertia of the different beams,
while satisfying constraints on displacements. Once a
global design is obtained, the framework is analyzed to
obtain the end loads on the beams. At the local level, each
beam is designed separately. Its detailed dimensions are
proportioned so as achieve the values of cross-sectional
area and bending moment of inertia chosen at the global
level while satisfying constraints on stresses and local
buckling. 	This is done by minimizing a measure of the
violation of the subproblem constraints. An optimum
sensitivity analysis (Ref. 22) is then performed in order to
obtain a linear approximation to the constraint violation of
each local level subproblem in terms of the global level
variables. The whole optimization is repeated, but, at the
global level, it is required that the (linearized) local
level constraint violations be reduced. This iterative
process is pursued until all the local and global level
constraints are satisfied and the framework weight cannot be
reduced further. Although the proposed scheme is applied to
a structural synthesis problem, it is applicable to any typeOt;i 	 L	r,	
9
OF POOP QUALITY
of engineering design. Furthermore, it may be used with
decompositions involving more than two levels. Some of the
key features of the approach are discussed below.
The method postulates a multilevel decomposition of the
problem, that is, a decomposition where the different
subproblems are grouped on the levels of a hierarchy. The
subproblem at the top level is concerned with the
optimization of the overall system objective in terms of
design variables describing that system in very global
terms. As one proceeds down the hierarchy, the subproblems
are dealing wi~h subsystems described in deeper and deeper
levels of detail. The choice of the specifics of the
decomposition for a given application still remains largely
a matter of physical insight and convenience.
Below the highest level, each subproblem is concerned
with finding a set of design variables which satisfy its own
constraints for fixed values of higher level variables. It
turns out that this amounts to finding a design vector which
satisfies a set of equality constraints and a set of
inequality constraints. Such a mathematical problem may not
have a solution. It may be transformed into a mathematical
programming problem which maximizes a measure of "how well"
the design satisfies the sets of constraints. The
subproblem formulation of Ref. 21 uses the equality10
ORIGINAL PAGE 19
OF POOR QUALITY
constraints to eliminate dependent variables and forms a
penalty function with the inequality constraints. That
penalty function is a measure of constraint violation which
is then minimized with respect to the independent variables
to find that design which best meets the constraints.
Once designs are obtained for all the subproblems on a
given level, sensitivity analyses are performed to determine
the effect changes in higher level variables have on lower
level constraint violations. The resulting sensitivity
derivatives are used to construct linear approximations to
the lower subproblem constraint violations in terms of the
higher level design variables. 	These approximations are
added as constraints for the next optimization of the higher
level subproblems. This enables the optimization of the
higher level subproblems to be conducted so as to improve
the design of the lower level subproblems which have
violated constraints or so as to reduce the margin of
satisfaction for those subproblems for which all constraints
are amply satisfied. In essence, this makes the trade-offs
between the different subproblems visible and allows them to
be resolved in a rational fashion.
The task of the highest level subproblem remains the
optimization of the system performance index with respect to
its own global variables which are required not only toI= POOR QUALITY
satisfy its own constraints but also to reduce the
constraint violation for the lower level subproblems.
1.2	OUTLINE
The purpose of this work has been to investigate the
applicability of Sobieski's method to the design of complex,
multidisciplinary engineering systems. It was elected to
focus the effort on a specific example: the simultaneous
aerodynamic and structural design of a high-performance
sailplane wing for maximum cross-country speed. 	It was
determined that this design problem could be carried out by
means of a four-level decomposition. An algorithm was
developed to solve the problem and it was tested on the two
lower levels of the decomposition.
In Chapter II, we discuss the optimum sensitivity
analysis technique. We show that the stationary conditions
satisfied at a local constrained optimum may be used to
determine the sensitivity of optimum objective functions and
design variables to changes in those parameters that were
kept fixed during the optimization.
Chapter III is devoted to a detailed description of the
proposed algorithm. It is constructed along the same lines
as that described in Ref. 20. The main difference resides
with the specifics of the mathematical formulation for the12
OF pOOR QUALITY
individual subproblems. The present algorithm treats
equality constraints in a general numerical fashion.
Furthermore, it is designed as a constrained programming
problem rather than as a penalty function minimization
problem. Particular attention is paid to the potential
difficulties associated with decompositions that involve
more than two levels.
In Chapter IV, the decomposition proposed for the example
problem is detailed. It is a four-level decomposition. The
highest level subproblem entails selection of global
performance parameters which include weight and aerodynamic
characteristics. Then follows an aerodynamic subproblem
where the shape of the wing is defined so as to obtain the
aerodynamic characteristics specified in the performance
subproblem and control the initiation bf stall. On the
third level of the decomposition is a global structural
subproblem where the wing -spanwise distributions of weight
and stiffnesses are selected for fixed total weight and so
as to limit the wing bending response and torsional
divergence speed. Finally, at the lowest level, the wing is
modeled by a series of spanwise elements each of which is
designed separately for fixed weight and stiffnesses under
stress and local buckling constraints.
sl13
In Chapter V, the algorithm introduced in Chap. III is
applied to the two lower levels of the hierarchy described
in Chap. IV. The problem solved is the minimum weight
design of a straight composite wing. Results are given for
designs started from both the feasible space and the
infeasible space.
Finally, Chapter VI is devoted to synthesizing the
experience gained with this work and making recommendations
for continued investigation.OF POOR QJHLi d V

SUMMARY OF PERTINENT RESULTS FROM OPTIMUM
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Optimum sensitivity analysis is a technique which permits
one to investigate the sensitivity of the solution of an
optimization problem to variations in the parameters of the
problem. It yields derivatives of the optimum values of the
design variables and objective function with respect to the
parameters, derivatives which may then be used to perform
trade-off analyses. These derivatives are called
sensitivity derivatives to distinguish them from the
derivatives of objective function and constraints with
respect to the design variables which are termed behavior
derivatives. 	This technique was recently introduced by
Sobieski and coauthors (Ref. 22) as a tool for structural
synthesis. It has been specialized by Schmit and Chang
(Ref. 23) to a formulation of the problem of structural
sizing for mimimum weight based on approximation concepts
and dual methods, and has been used by Haftka (Ref.  24 ) in
the optimization of damage tolerant structures. The
elements of the technique required for the remainder of this
work are discussed in this chapter; the reader interested in
a more general discussion should consult Ref. 22.

The optimum sensitivity derivative of the objective function

where subscript p indicates partial derivatives with respect
to vector P. Now, we can show that F' may be found without
actually calculating X'. We require that the optimum point

Eqs. 2.3 is stationary with respect to P,

Equation 2.11 represents k sets of m a linear equations in n

values to n-m a components of each column of Y and deduce the
remaining m a components from Eq. 2.11. In general, Y
differs from the true sensitivity derivatives of the
variables X' , unless n = m a. Assume that, in the space of
the design variables X, an infinitesimal perturbation of
parameter P results in a move from the initial point in the
direction specified by Y. Then, the resulting design is
still at the intersection of the originally active
constraints because condition 2.7 is enforced; however, it
may not be optimum because the first of Eqs. 2.3 may not be

The approach of Sec. 2.2 yields the exact value of F' at
considerably lower cost than that of Sec. 2.3 since it
involves only first-order partial derivatives of F and q 
with respect to the design variables and parameters of the
problem. However, it does not usually permit one to obtain
X' (unless n = m a). The choice between the two types of
analysis is very much dependent on the application
considered and the nature of the optimization problem at
hand. It must be guided by a comparison between the cost of
calculating second-order partial derivatives of F and g  on
the one hand, and the benefit of knowing the sensitivity
derivatives of the variables on the other hand.
It must be noted that higher order sensitivity
derivatives may be obtained for X F and X by setting
higher order total derivatives of the two first stationary
conditions (Eqs. 2.3) to zero. In particular, Ref. 25 shows
how little additional calculation is required to find F",
once X' has been obtained.

After solving a mathematical programming problem and

find the set of the active constraints. These constraints

linearly independent, if one wants to obtain the Lagrange
multipliers from Eq. 2.10. The algorithm described below
was used with success.
i)Select an initial set S  of nearly satisfied
constraints by retaining those constraints whose
value is above a small negative tolerance.
ii)Identify S pa, the subset of S a which contains the
maximum number of constraints with independent
gradients. To achieve that, the constraint
gradients are taken as the columns of a rectangular
matrix and a Gaussian elimination with row and
column interchanges is performed to identify the
independent columns.
iii)Use Eq. 2.10 to find the Lagrange multipliers
corresponding to set S pa. Note that the fact that
the constraints of set Spa have independent
gradients is a guarantee that Eq. 2.10 has a
solution.
iv)Find the smallest Lagrange multiplier ai.
V)	If X. is negative (less than a small positive
tolerance), eliminate constraint i from set S  and
restart the process in ii). 	If X  is positive,
terminate the process since S'a is the desired set.22	'3F ? DR U` F_:
Note that steps ii) and iii) would not be required if QR
decomposition were used. In step v), only the constraints
with strictly positive Lagrange multipliers are kept, even
though active constraints may have Lagrange multipliers that
are zero. This is because constraints with zero Lagrange
multipliers are redundant; hence, their gradients are
linearly dependent on other constraint gradients.
In this work, the sensitivity derivatives are used to
extend optimization information over a range of variation
for the parameters of the design problems considered. This
is achieved by means of the linear extrapolations given in
Eq. 2.5. The implicit relationships 2.2 are expected to be
nonlinear, in general. Hence, the extrapolations being
first-order Taylor series expansions, they are valid only
for limited AP. Furthermore, the calculation of the
sensitivity derivatives is based on the assumption that the
set of constraints active at the initial optimum will remain
unchanged as the parameter P is changed to P+AP.
Perturbations of the parameters cause moves of the
constraint boundaries with respect to each other and,
therefore, may very well result in changes in the active
constraint set. These changes then imply reduced accuracy
of the extrapolated optima. The question arises of whether
it is possible to estimate the magnitude of the parameterOF POOR QvA° ITY
perturbations which cause changes in the active constraint
set. It was proposed in Ref. 22 that the perturbation of
parameter p (element of vector P) which results in
constraint i changing from active status to inactive status
may be obtained to the first order by stating that X  is
reduced to zero when constraint i leaves the active set,
Xi(P+APi) _ Xi(P)+Xi(P)APi = 0
or
Opi = -ai(P)/Xi(P)	(2.15)
Reference 22 likewise suggested that the perturbation of
parameter p causing constraint i to change from inactive
status to active status could be found as that value ep i for
which gi(p+Api) becomes zero.
gi(P+APi) = gi(P)+1gix(P)X'(P)1APi = 0
then
APi= -gi(P)/Igix( P)X'(P))	(2.16)
It was observed in Ref. 26 that Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 could be
unreliable. These estimates were used to determine with a
specific design problem example what parameter perturbations
cause changes in the status of the different constraints247^ "n
OF POOR QJAUTY
involved, attempting so to speak, to construct an history
of the active constraint set as p varies. This may not be
an appropriate approach. Indeed, Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 may be
used to estimate a Ap i for each of the problem constraints,
indicating when the status of a particular constraint is
supposed to change. However, only the smallest (in absolute
value) negative and positive of these dp i (Ap_ and 4p+)
should be taken into consideration. The extrapolations
based on sensitivity derivatives obtained at p should be
adequate for p+Ap - < p+pp 5 p+pp +, But any prediction
beyond that range (in particular prediction of change in the
active constraint set) should not be relied upon since it
would have been obtained with derivatives corresponding to
an inappropriate active constraint set. In essence, as
suggested in Ref. 23, the Ap i of Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 must be
regarded as bounds on Op. Barring excessive nonlinearity,
the range of ep defined by the intersection of these bounds
is that within which the extrapolations based on sensitivity
derivatives calculated at p should be reliable. 	In the
absence of changes in the active constraint set, the
accuracy of Eq. 	2.5 is limited only by the inherent
nonlinearity of the specific design problem considered.
Experiments conducted with various structural design
problems showed (Ref. 22) that linear-extrapolation-based25

estimates of optimum objective functions and design
variables fell within a few percent of actual optimization
result, for parameter variations of up to twenty percent;
the predictions often were better for the objective function
than for the design variables.(n^ niece,.

PRESENTATION OF THE ALGORITHM
This chapter is devoted to discussing an algorithm proposed
for the design of complex engineering systems. The method
is based on multilevel decomposition of the corresponding
design problems 	into	subproblems 	which	are	solved
separately. 	The algorithm is discussed in general terms.
This is done so as to avoid focusing on a particular
problem. 	The following chapter will be devoted to
investigating the applicability of the approach described
here to a specific problem. 	The abstract concepts
introduced here can be more easily put in a physical context
if this chapter and the following one are read
simultaneously. The presentation begins with a definition
of the type of multilevel decomposition considered and of
the components of that decomposition. Then, the discussion
centers on the formulation and solution of the subproblems.
Finally, the organization of the overall optimization is
discussed. 	The developments follow those by Sobieski in
Ref. 20.

The starting point of this discussion is the task of
designing a system by finding a set of variables which
optimize a performance index while satisfying a number of
constraints. This will be referred to as the
overall problem. Assume that, for convenience, the overall
problem is decomposed into a number of subproblems, each of
which corresponds to the design of a subsystem, and has its
own sets of variables and constraints. The subproblems are
organized in a hierarchy as shown on Fig. 1. The subproblem
at the top of the hierarchy is the design of the whole
system, in very general terms. The next level deals with
major subsystems, the third one with subsystems of the major
subsystems, and so on. As one goes down the levels, the
details of the system become more and more precisely
defined. The subproblems are identified by two numbers ij
which define (i) the level of the subproblem, and (j) its
position on that level. 	The level numbers increase
downward, and the subproblem numbers increase, say, from
left to right. The hierarchy is assumed to have 1 levels,
there are n  subproblems on level i.
The whole design process is conducted iteratively,
starting at the highest level and going down. 	Each
subsystem is designed separately. 	The object of the
algorithm is to coordinate the design of the different28

subsystems so as to obtain optimum system performance by
resolving the trade-offs between the subsystems in a
rational fashion. This is achieved by manipulating two
types of interactions between the subproblems: the controls
and the responses. A control is a quantity selected in a
subproblem to influence another subproblem in the hierarchy.
A response is a quantity that reflects the effect the design
of one subproblem has on that of another subproblem. In
this work, we assume that the controls flow exclusively
downward in the hierarchy, while the responses flow
exclusively upward. This excludes situations where a
subproblem controls another subproblem on the same level
(lateral control) or on a higher level (reverse control).'
As represented symbolically on Fig. 2, each subproblem is
assumed to receive controls from higher level subproblems
through vector CI ij (control inputs in subproblem if), and
to receive responses from lower level subproblems through
vector RIij (response inputs in subproblem i1). Also, each
subproblem is assumed to control lower level subproblems
with vector COij (control outputs from subproblem i^), and
' In Ref. 20, the controls are named interaction quantities.
The interested reader should refer to that source for
indications as to how to handle reverse and lateral
controls.c) Highest level subproblem.

to respond to higher level subproblems with vector ROij
(response outputs from subproblem ice). This discussion does
not make any assumption on the specific form of the
controls, except that the control outputs from a subproblem
depend on the variables of that subproblem; they may be the
variables themselves or functions of these variables (CO .j =i
Coij(Xij)). Likewise, the controls imposed on subproblem ij
(CI ij) are not specified , except that they are assumed
known once all the control outputs from higher level
subproblems (Co ri, a<i) are known. The response outputs
from a subproblem (RO ij) will be defined in this chapter.
Furthermore, it will be shown that the response inputs into
a subproblem (RI ij) are entirely known once the response
outputs from the lower level subproblems (RO as, a>i) are
known.
For each iteration of the overall system, each subproblem
is concerned with finding a design which satisfies its own
constraints for the controls specified by the higher level
subproblems (CI ij). In addition, the subproblem manipulates
its own controls (CO..) so as to improve the responses from
the lower level subproblems (RI ij ).	Mathematically, this
implies finding a design vector that satisfies a set of0"KY A p P cn- n
32	OF POOR QUALITY
equality constraints and a set of inequality constraints.
This problem may be solved by transforming it into a
nonlinear mathematical programming problem where a measure
of constraint violation is minimized with respect to the
design vector. The subproblem's own response (RO ij) is then
constituted of the minimum measure of constraint violation
as well as derivatives indicating the sensitivity of that
minimum measure to changes in the controls imposed on the
subproblem.
The subproblem on the highest level of the hierarchy
drives the whole design process. It selects its own design
variables so as to optimize the overall problem performance
index and satisfy its own constraints. It adjusts its
controls (CO 11) to improve the responses from the lower
levels (RI 11), that is, reduce the constraint violation in
the lower level subproblems.

3.1.a). These are the constraints set on the corresponding
subsystem in the statement of the overall non-decomposed
problem. The design is also subject to a set of equality
constraints (Eq. 3.1.b). Some of these may come from the
formulation of the overall non-decomposed problem; some are
imposed on the subproblem during decomposition. The
multilevel decomposition consists of different models of the
system being designed, the models becoming more refined as
one progresses down the hierarchy. The equality constraints
arise from the necessity of requiring consistency between
the models at different levels. Also, some upper and lower
bounds may be set on the variables (Eq. 3.1.c). As stated
in the previous section, the subproblem is assumed to be
controlled by each subproblem on the higher levels. As a
result, the vector of controls CI lj is functionally
dependent on the optimum designs of all the subproblems
above the lowest level.34

Problem 3.1 2 may have from zero to an infinity of
solutions, depending on the controls CI lj . We transform it
into a nonlinear mathematical programming problem by
introducing two new variables Elj and n1j which are used to
relax inequality and equality constraints. These new
variables are combined into a composite function which is a
global measure of constraint violation and which is
minimized to identify the "best" design. The transformed

where b is a positive constant. Each equality constraint is
replaced by two inequality constraints (Eq. 3.3.c). The
distance between these constraints (2n ij ) is forced to
remain positive because of Eq. 3.3.e and to decrease because
of the second term in the objective function. 	Each
inequality constraint is relaxed by the addition of variable
E: mechanism of that relaxation is described in Fig.
3, for a simple two-dimensional problem with one equality
and three inequality constraints, assuming that the equality
constraint is identically satisfied. The first term in the
objective function (Eq. 3.3.a) is defined so as to increase
Eli . A high positive value for Eli is quite acceptable as
it means that the selected design point is deep inside the
feasible domain, away from the constraint boundaries, and
that decreases the chances of obtaining infeasible designs
when the controls are perturbed. If the solution of Problem
3.3 is so that Eli z 0 and Ti lj = 0, then it solves Problem
3.1. If, on the other hand, we have Elj < 0 or Ti lj x 0,
then the resulting design is infeasible with respect to
Problem 3.1.
Constant b is added to the definition of the objective
function to control the importance attributed to violatingOF POOP: QJA i"d Y
the different constraints. A high value for b results in a
heavy penalty paid for violating equality constraints;
conversely, a low value for b makes the penalty for
violating inequality constraints more important, in relative
terms. In addition to adjusting b, it may prove appropriate
to scale variables E1j and n1j in order to make all
components of the constraint gradients of the same order of
magnitude.
Any nonlinear programming algorithm may be used to solve
Problem 3.3. 	This yields X lj, as well as a measure of
inequality constraint violation E1j and a measure of
equality constraint violation n1j. These are functionally
dependent on the controls CI 1j and, therefore, as indicated
by Eq. 3.2, on the optimum design variables of subproblems
on higher levels. Optimum sensitivity analysis may be used
to study the effect changes in higher level subproblem
variables have on the constraint violations for subproblem

DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTILEVEL OPTIMIZATION APPROACH TO THE DESIGN
OF MODERN ENGINEERING SYSTEMS
by
Jean-Francois Marie Barthelemy
(ABSTRACT)
This work describes an optimization approach to the design
of complex engineering systems. The approach assumes a
decomposition of the original problem (design of the system)
into smaller subproblems (design of subsystems) organized in
a multilevel hierarchy. As one goes down the levels, the
details of the system become more precisely defined;
furthermore, each subproblem may control the design of lower
level subproblems.
A general algorithm is proposed which carries out the
design process iteratively, starting at the top of the
hierarchy and proceeding downward. Each subproblem is
optimized separately for fixed controls from higher level
subproblems. 	An optimum sensitivity analysis is then
performed which determines the sensitivity of the subproblem

design to changes in higher level subproblem controls. The
resulting sensitivity derivatives are used to construct
constraints which force the controlling subproblems into
chosing their own designs so as to improve the lower level
subproblem designs while satisfying their own constraints.
The applicability of the proposed algorithm is
demonstrated by devising a four-level hierarchy to perform
the simultaneous aerodynamic and structural design_ of a
high-performance sailplane wing for maximum cross-country
speed.	The levels are devoted successively to selecting
global	performance parameters, 	determining 	the wing
aerodynamic shape, defining the spanwise distributions of
global structural characteristics, 	and, performing the
detailed design of wing substructures.
Finally, the concepts discussed are applied to the two-
level minimum weight structural design of the sailplane
wing. The numerical experiments show that discontinuities
in the sensitivity derivatives may delay convergence, but
that the algorithm is robust enough to overcome these
discontinuities and produce low-weight feasible designs,
regardless of whether the optimization is started from the
feasible space or the infeasible one.

INTRODUCTION
The design of modern engineering systems is a procedure
which often integrates different disciplines and always
involves a large number of variables. While optimization
techniques provide an attractive formal tool for carrying
out the design process, a weakness of these techniques
remains in their inability to handle 	truly large
multidisciplinary design problems. 	To overcome that
weakness, designers must resort to some sort of
decomposition method. The original design problem is broken
down into smaller subproblems which are then optimized
separately. However, these subproblems are generally
coupled so that an iterative scheme must be devised which
coordinates their optimization in order that the resulting
design is, to some extent, optimum with respect to the
original problem.
1.1	OVERVIEW OF EXISTING LITERATURE
Several studies have been devoted to decomposition of large
optimization problems. These studies pertain to all the
areas of engineering as well as economics and management.
The following overview focuses mainly on structuralOF POOR 	 eW
optimization. For the sake of the discussion, two classes
of decomposition methods are defined: formal methods and
intuitive methods. In formal methods, the mathematical
structure of the problem is exploited to arrive at a rigid
decomposition scheme. Consequently, a rigorous framework
exists within which the mathematical properties of the
method may be assessed. In intuitive methods, understanding
of the behavior of the physical system considered is
apparently the prime factor directing the decomposition.
These methods are sometimes referred to as rational methods
and their mathematical characteristics can seldom be studied
in great detail. An intuitive approach provides, of course,
the only option for decomposing those problems which do not
possess the structure for which a formal decomposition
method exists. This division into formal and intuitive
methods is somewhat arbitrary as a given approach may very
well be shown to belong to both classes; however,it
facilitates the discussion.
1.1.1	Formal Decomposition Methods
A very extensive body of work exists on decomposition in
linear programming (LP). The existence of truly large
problems in the fields of economics and operations research
has stimulated efforts aiming at exploiting the specialOF, POOR ft:{rv^ a ^}^^
structures of the constraint matrix. The major initial step
in that area seems to have been the introduction of the
Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle in 1960. By 1970 the
developments in this active field were so numerous as to
warrant the publication of a textbook by Lasdon (Ref. 1).
In the area of structural design, problems involving
collapse design of trusses and frames were solved
successfully using the LP decomposition techniques (Refs.
2-5).
Dynamic programming (DP) was discussed by Bellman as
early as 1957 (Ref. 6). 	It is a decomposition method
suitable for nonlinear problems. The problems must be
serial, that is, of the form such that any change in the
design of one subproblem affects only those subproblems that
are	"downstream" 	in	the	decision-making 	process.
Furthermore, the problem objective function must be
additive. However, DP cannot easily handle constraints that
involve more than one subproblem. Also, it becomes very
expensive if there are large amounts of data transmitted
between successive subproblems. Among the advantages of the
DP method are its capability to generate global optimum
designs and to handle discrete variables and discontinuous
functions. In structural design, dynamic programming seems
to find use in optimization of "one-dimensional" structures,OF POOR QU ? â‚¬TV
N
that is, beams, one-bay multistory or one-story multibay
frames, and transmission towers (see Ref. 7 Chap. XI or Ref.
8).
Optimization algorithms were devised for separable
nonlinear problems using coordination techniques developed
in the context of multilevel decision-making processes.
Once a problem has been decomposed into smaller subproblems,
the main task is to coordinate the design of the different
subproblems. Essentially, the subproblems are grouped on
the lower level of a hierarchy and an additional higher
level subproblem is added whose role is to select the values
of coordinating variables so as to force the other
subproblems into choosing designs corresponding to improved
overall problem performance. The coordinating subproblem is
itself cast in the form of an optimization problem. As the
evaluation of the objective function of the coordinating
subproblem requires complete optimization of all lower level
subproblems, this type of algorithm may turn out to be very
expensive. A study of coordination in hierarchical systems
is given in the 1970 monograph by Mesarovic and coauthors
(Ref. 9). Kirsch and coworkers have used both the model
coordination technique and the goal coordination technique
to solve various structural design problems (Ref. 7 Chap. X
and Refs. 10-12)1.1.2	Intuitive Decomposition Methods
The first attempts at developing intuitive decomposition
schemes for large structural design problems were extensions
of the fully stressed design method. In these approaches
the structure is seen as a combination of elements
(substructures). 	Given an initial design for all the
elements, an analysis of the structure is made to determine
inter-element forces. 	Then, each element is optimized
separately on the assumption that changes in that element
design do not change inter-element forces. Once all the
elements have ,been designed, the structure is analyzed again
and the process repeated until convergence is achieved.
Giles (Ref. 13) and Sobieski (Ref. 14) performed the design
of airplane wings under constraints on stresses and element
stability using that approach. Kirsch and coworkers (Ref.
15) designed frameworks using a similar approach but
reanalyzing 	the	structure 	after	each	substructure
optimization, 	in order to account better for load
redistribution.
When optimizing a structure one substructure at a time,
it is difficult to handle global constraints, that is, those
constraints affected by variables belonging to more than one
substructure. In Ref. 16, Sobieski and Loendorf designed
airplane fuselages under local constraints on stresses and6
OF P'^JCR
local instabilities and global constraints on fuselage
elastic displacements. The optimization was first carried
out with the local constraints, as described above. If
necessary, the resulting design was subsequently modified to
satisfy the displacement constraints using a unit load
method to determine the impact that changes in element
design have on the violated displacements. Another example
of treatment of global constraints is given by Hughes and
coworkers (Ref. 17) who designed ship compartments for
minimum cost under constraints on stresses.
A generalized fully stressed design approach to large
problems is certainly economically appealing. However, it
presents two difficulties. As pointed out in Ref. 14
"...minimization of the individual component masses does not
guarantee minimization of the total mass This situation
is caused by the inability to control the load path on the
assembled structure level... ." As mentioned earlier also,
it makes it difficult to handle global constraints. 	In
Refs. 18 and 19 Schmit and coworkers used a two-level
approach to design trusses and aircraft wings. At the
global level, the distributions of stiffnesses, the global
level variables, were chosen so as to minimize the total
structural weight, while satisfying global displacement
constraints and also some local constraints on stresses andORIGINA L PAGE @S 	7

structural element buckling. For known stiffnesses, the end
forces on the various structural elements were calculated.
At the local level, these structural elements were optimized
separately with respect to their detail design, the local
level variables, so that the changes in element stiffnesses
were minimized, while the local constraints were still
satisfied. The process was repeated until convergence was
achieved. In this decomposition, the introduction of the
global level problem was a key factor in overcoming both
difficulties . attributed to the generalized fully stressed
design approach. By placing the minimization of the weight
at the global level, the opportunity was kept to trade
structural mass between the elements in order to improve the
load paths while reducing the total weight. 	Also, the
provision was left to explicitly handle global constraints.
1.1.3	General Approach to Engineering System Design
The intuitive decomposition methods discussed to this point
are very specific and cannot easily be extended to different
classes of problems. In particular, they are not suited for
multidisciplinary problems. In Ref. 20, Sobieski proposed a
general approach to the design of large engineering systems,
and in Ref. 21, he proceeded to demonstrate the proposed
concepts by applying them to the two-level minimum weight8	 ORIGINAL RAGE IS
OF POOR QUALITY
design of a portal framework under local constraints on
stresses and local buckling and global constraints on
displacement. At the global level, the weight of the
framework is minimized with respect to the cross-sectional
area and bending moment of inertia of the different beams,
while satisfying constraints on displacements. Once a
global design is obtained, the framework is analyzed to
obtain the end loads on the beams. At the local level, each
beam is designed separately. Its detailed dimensions are
proportioned so as achieve the values of cross-sectional
area and bending moment of inertia chosen at the global
level while satisfying constraints on stresses and local
buckling. 	This is done by minimizing a measure of the
violation of the subproblem constraints. An optimum
sensitivity analysis (Ref. 22) is then performed in order to
obtain a linear approximation to the constraint violation of
each local level subproblem in terms of the global level
variables. The whole optimization is repeated, but, at the
global level, it is required that the (linearized) local
level constraint violations be reduced. This iterative
process is pursued until all the local and global level
constraints are satisfied and the framework weight cannot be
reduced further. Although the proposed scheme is applied to
a structural synthesis problem, it is applicable to any typeOt;i 	 L	r,

OF POOP QUALITY
of engineering design. Furthermore, it may be used with
decompositions involving more than two levels. Some of the
key features of the approach are discussed below.
The method postulates a multilevel decomposition of the
problem, that is, a decomposition where the different
subproblems are grouped on the levels of a hierarchy. The
subproblem at the top level is concerned with the
optimization of the overall system objective in terms of
design variables describing that system in very global
terms. As one proceeds down the hierarchy, the subproblems
are dealing wi~h subsystems described in deeper and deeper
levels of detail. The choice of the specifics of the
decomposition for a given application still remains largely
a matter of physical insight and convenience.
Below the highest level, each subproblem is concerned
with finding a set of design variables which satisfy its own
constraints for fixed values of higher level variables. It
turns out that this amounts to finding a design vector which
satisfies a set of equality constraints and a set of
inequality constraints. Such a mathematical problem may not
have a solution. It may be transformed into a mathematical
programming problem which maximizes a measure of "how well"
the design satisfies the sets of constraints. The
subproblem formulation of Ref. 21 uses the equality10
ORIGINAL PAGE 19
OF POOR QUALITY
constraints to eliminate dependent variables and forms a
penalty function with the inequality constraints. That
penalty function is a measure of constraint violation which
is then minimized with respect to the independent variables
to find that design which best meets the constraints.
Once designs are obtained for all the subproblems on a
given level, sensitivity analyses are performed to determine
the effect changes in higher level variables have on lower
level constraint violations. The resulting sensitivity
derivatives are used to construct linear approximations to
the lower subproblem constraint violations in terms of the
higher level design variables. 	These approximations are
added as constraints for the next optimization of the higher
level subproblems. This enables the optimization of the
higher level subproblems to be conducted so as to improve
the design of the lower level subproblems which have
violated constraints or so as to reduce the margin of
satisfaction for those subproblems for which all constraints
are amply satisfied. In essence, this makes the trade-offs
between the different subproblems visible and allows them to
be resolved in a rational fashion.
The task of the highest level subproblem remains the
optimization of the system performance index with respect to
its own global variables which are required not only toI= POOR QUALITY
satisfy its own constraints but also to reduce the
constraint violation for the lower level subproblems.
1.2	OUTLINE
The purpose of this work has been to investigate the
applicability of Sobieski's method to the design of complex,
multidisciplinary engineering systems. It was elected to
focus the effort on a specific example: the simultaneous
aerodynamic and structural design of a high-performance
sailplane wing for maximum cross-country speed. 	It was
determined that this design problem could be carried out by
means of a four-level decomposition. An algorithm was
developed to solve the problem and it was tested on the two
lower levels of the decomposition.
In Chapter II, we discuss the optimum sensitivity
analysis technique. We show that the stationary conditions
satisfied at a local constrained optimum may be used to
determine the sensitivity of optimum objective functions and
design variables to changes in those parameters that were
kept fixed during the optimization.
Chapter III is devoted to a detailed description of the
proposed algorithm. It is constructed along the same lines
as that described in Ref. 20. The main difference resides
with the specifics of the mathematical formulation for the12
OF pOOR QUALITY
individual subproblems. The present algorithm treats
equality constraints in a general numerical fashion.
Furthermore, it is designed as a constrained programming
problem rather than as a penalty function minimization
problem. Particular attention is paid to the potential
difficulties associated with decompositions that involve
more than two levels.
In Chapter IV, the decomposition proposed for the example
problem is detailed. It is a four-level decomposition. The
highest level subproblem entails selection of global
performance parameters which include weight and aerodynamic
characteristics. Then follows an aerodynamic subproblem
where the shape of the wing is defined so as to obtain the
aerodynamic characteristics specified in the performance
subproblem and control the initiation bf stall. On the
third level of the decomposition is a global structural
subproblem where the wing -spanwise distributions of weight
and stiffnesses are selected for fixed total weight and so
as to limit the wing bending response and torsional
divergence speed. Finally, at the lowest level, the wing is
modeled by a series of spanwise elements each of which is
designed separately for fixed weight and stiffnesses under
stress and local buckling constraints.
sl13
In Chapter V, the algorithm introduced in Chap. III is
applied to the two lower levels of the hierarchy described
in Chap. IV. The problem solved is the minimum weight
design of a straight composite wing. Results are given for
designs started from both the feasible space and the
infeasible space.
Finally, Chapter VI is devoted to synthesizing the
experience gained with this work and making recommendations
for continued investigation.OF POOR QJHLi d V

SUMMARY OF PERTINENT RESULTS FROM OPTIMUM
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Optimum sensitivity analysis is a technique which permits
one to investigate the sensitivity of the solution of an
optimization problem to variations in the parameters of the
problem. It yields derivatives of the optimum values of the
design variables and objective function with respect to the
parameters, derivatives which may then be used to perform
trade-off analyses. These derivatives are called
sensitivity derivatives to distinguish them from the
derivatives of objective function and constraints with
respect to the design variables which are termed behavior
derivatives. 	This technique was recently introduced by
Sobieski and coauthors (Ref. 22) as a tool for structural
synthesis. It has been specialized by Schmit and Chang
(Ref. 23) to a formulation of the problem of structural
sizing for mimimum weight based on approximation concepts
and dual methods, and has been used by Haftka (Ref.  24 ) in
the optimization of damage tolerant structures. The
elements of the technique required for the remainder of this
work are discussed in this chapter; the reader interested in
a more general discussion should consult Ref. 22.

The optimum sensitivity derivative of the objective function
is obtained by the chain rule of differentiation as

where subscript p indicates partial derivatives with respect
to vector P. Now, we can show that F' may be found without
actually calculating X'. We require that the optimum point

Eqs. 2.3 is stationary with respect to P,

values to n-m a components of each column of Y and deduce the
remaining m a components from Eq. 2.11. In general, Y
differs from the true sensitivity derivatives of the
variables X' , unless n = m a. Assume that, in the space of
the design variables X, an infinitesimal perturbation of
parameter P results in a move from the initial point in the
direction specified by Y. Then, the resulting design is
still at the intersection of the originally active
constraints because condition 2.7 is enforced; however, it
may not be optimum because the first of Eqs. 2.3 may not be

The approach of Sec. 2.2 yields the exact value of F' at
considerably lower cost than that of Sec. 2.3 since it
involves only first-order partial derivatives of F and q 
with respect to the design variables and parameters of the
problem. However, it does not usually permit one to obtain
X' (unless n = m a). The choice between the two types of
analysis is very much dependent on the application
considered and the nature of the optimization problem at
hand. It must be guided by a comparison between the cost of
calculating second-order partial derivatives of F and g  on
the one hand, and the benefit of knowing the sensitivity
derivatives of the variables on the other hand.
It must be noted that higher order sensitivity
derivatives may be obtained for X F and X by setting
higher order total derivatives of the two first stationary
conditions (Eqs. 2.3) to zero. In particular, Ref. 25 shows
how little additional calculation is required to find F",
once X' has been obtained.

After solving a mathematical programming problem and

find the set of the active constraints. These constraints

linearly independent, if one wants to obtain the Lagrange
multipliers from Eq. 2.10. The algorithm described below
was used with success.
i)Select an initial set S  of nearly satisfied
constraints by retaining those constraints whose
value is above a small negative tolerance.
ii)Identify S pa, the subset of S a which contains the
maximum number of constraints with independent
gradients. To achieve that, the constraint
gradients are taken as the columns of a rectangular
matrix and a Gaussian elimination with row and
column interchanges is performed to identify the
independent columns.
iii)Use Eq. 2.10 to find the Lagrange multipliers
corresponding to set S pa. Note that the fact that
the constraints of set Spa have independent
gradients is a guarantee that Eq. 2.10 has a
solution.
iv)Find the smallest Lagrange multiplier ai.
V)	If X. is negative (less than a small positive
tolerance), eliminate constraint i from set S  and
restart the process in ii). 	If X  is positive,
terminate the process since S'a is the desired set.22	'3F ? DR U` F_:
Note that steps ii) and iii) would not be required if QR
decomposition were used. In step v), only the constraints
with strictly positive Lagrange multipliers are kept, even
though active constraints may have Lagrange multipliers that
are zero. This is because constraints with zero Lagrange
multipliers are redundant; hence, their gradients are
linearly dependent on other constraint gradients.
In this work, the sensitivity derivatives are used to
extend optimization information over a range of variation
for the parameters of the design problems considered. This
is achieved by means of the linear extrapolations given in
Eq. 2.5. The implicit relationships 2.2 are expected to be
nonlinear, in general. Hence, the extrapolations being
first-order Taylor series expansions, they are valid only
for limited AP. Furthermore, the calculation of the
sensitivity derivatives is based on the assumption that the
set of constraints active at the initial optimum will remain
unchanged as the parameter P is changed to P+AP.
Perturbations of the parameters cause moves of the
constraint boundaries with respect to each other and,
therefore, may very well result in changes in the active
constraint set. These changes then imply reduced accuracy
of the extrapolated optima. The question arises of whether
it is possible to estimate the magnitude of the parameterOF POOR QvAÂ° ITY
perturbations which cause changes in the active constraint
set. It was proposed in Ref. 22 that the perturbation of
parameter p (element of vector P) which results in
constraint i changing from active status to inactive status
may be obtained to the first order by stating that X  is
reduced to zero when constraint i leaves the active set,
Xi(P+APi) _ Xi(P)+Xi(P)APi = 0
or
Opi = -ai(P)/Xi(P)	(2.15)
Reference 22 likewise suggested that the perturbation of
parameter p causing constraint i to change from inactive
status to active status could be found as that value ep i for
which gi(p+Api) becomes zero.
gi(P+APi) = gi(P)+1gix(P)X'(P)1APi = 0
then
APi= -gi(P)/Igix( P)X'(P))	(2.16)
It was observed in Ref. 26 that Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 could be
unreliable. These estimates were used to determine with a
specific design problem example what parameter perturbations
cause changes in the status of the different constraints247^ "n
OF POOR QJAUTY
involved, attempting so to speak, to construct an history
of the active constraint set as p varies. This may not be
an appropriate approach. Indeed, Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 may be
used to estimate a Ap i for each of the problem constraints,
indicating when the status of a particular constraint is
supposed to change. However, only the smallest (in absolute
value) negative and positive of these dp i (Ap_ and 4p+)
should be taken into consideration. The extrapolations
based on sensitivity derivatives obtained at p should be
adequate for p+Ap - < p+pp 5 p+pp +, But any prediction
beyond that range (in particular prediction of change in the
active constraint set) should not be relied upon since it
would have been obtained with derivatives corresponding to
an inappropriate active constraint set. In essence, as
suggested in Ref. 23, the Ap i of Eqs. 2.15 and 2.16 must be
regarded as bounds on Op. Barring excessive nonlinearity,
the range of ep defined by the intersection of these bounds
is that within which the extrapolations based on sensitivity
derivatives calculated at p should be reliable. 	In the
absence of changes in the active constraint set, the
accuracy of Eq. 	2.5 is limited only by the inherent
nonlinearity of the specific design problem considered.
Experiments conducted with various structural design
problems showed (Ref. 22) that linear-extrapolation-based25

estimates of optimum objective functions and design
variables fell within a few percent of actual optimization
result, for parameter variations of up to twenty percent;
the predictions often were better for the objective function
than for the design variables.(n^ niece,.

PRESENTATION OF THE ALGORITHM
This chapter is devoted to discussing an algorithm proposed
for the design of complex engineering systems. The method
is based on multilevel decomposition of the corresponding
design problems 	into	subproblems 	which	are	solved
separately. 	The algorithm is discussed in general terms.
This is done so as to avoid focusing on a particular
problem. 	The following chapter will be devoted to
investigating the applicability of the approach described
here to a specific problem. 	The abstract concepts
introduced here can be more easily put in a physical context
if this chapter and the following one are read
simultaneously. The presentation begins with a definition
of the type of multilevel decomposition considered and of
the components of that decomposition. Then, the discussion
centers on the formulation and solution of the subproblems.
Finally, the organization of the overall optimization is
discussed. 	The developments follow those by Sobieski in
Ref. 20.

3.1	DEFINITIONS
The starting point of this discussion is the task of
designing a system by finding a set of variables which
optimize a performance index while satisfying a number of
constraints. This will be referred to as the
overall problem. Assume that, for convenience, the overall
problem is decomposed into a number of subproblems, each of
which corresponds to the design of a subsystem, and has its
own sets of variables and constraints. The subproblems are
organized in a hierarchy as shown on Fig. 1. The subproblem
at the top of the hierarchy is the design of the whole
system, in very general terms. The next level deals with
major subsystems, the third one with subsystems of the major
subsystems, and so on. As one goes down the levels, the
details of the system become more and more precisely
defined. The subproblems are identified by two numbers ij
which define (i) the level of the subproblem, and (j) its
position on that level. 	The level numbers increase
downward, and the subproblem numbers increase, say, from
left to right. The hierarchy is assumed to have 1 levels,
there are n  subproblems on level i.
The whole design process is conducted iteratively,
starting at the highest level and going down. 	Each
subsystem is designed separately. 	The object of the
algorithm is to coordinate the design of the different28

subsystems so as to obtain optimum system performance by
resolving the trade-offs between the subsystems in a
rational fashion. This is achieved by manipulating two
types of interactions between the subproblems: the controls
and the responses. A control is a quantity selected in a
subproblem to influence another subproblem in the hierarchy.
A response is a quantity that reflects the effect the design
of one subproblem has on that of another subproblem. In
this work, we assume that the controls flow exclusively
downward in the hierarchy, while the responses flow
exclusively upward. This excludes situations where a
subproblem controls another subproblem on the same level
(lateral control) or on a higher level (reverse control).'
As represented symbolically on Fig. 2, each subproblem is
assumed to receive controls from higher level subproblems
through vector CI ij (control inputs in subproblem if), and
to receive responses from lower level subproblems through
vector RIij (response inputs in subproblem i1). Also, each
subproblem is assumed to control lower level subproblems
with vector COij (control outputs from subproblem i^), and
' In Ref. 20, the controls are named interaction quantities.
The interested reader should refer to that source for
indications as to how to handle reverse and lateral
controls.c) Highest level subproblem.

to respond to higher level subproblems with vector ROij
(response outputs from subproblem ice). This discussion does
not make any assumption on the specific form of the
controls, except that the control outputs from a subproblem
depend on the variables of that subproblem; they may be the
variables themselves or functions of these variables (CO .j =i
Coij(Xij)). Likewise, the controls imposed on subproblem ij
(CI ij) are not specified , except that they are assumed
known once all the control outputs from higher level
subproblems (Co ri, a<i) are known. The response outputs
from a subproblem (RO ij) will be defined in this chapter.
Furthermore, it will be shown that the response inputs into
a subproblem (RI ij) are entirely known once the response
outputs from the lower level subproblems (RO as, a>i) are
known.
For each iteration of the overall system, each subproblem
is concerned with finding a design which satisfies its own
constraints for the controls specified by the higher level
subproblems (CI ij). In addition, the subproblem manipulates
its own controls (CO..) so as to improve the responses from
the lower level subproblems (RI ij ).	Mathematically, this
implies finding a design vector that satisfies a set of0"KY A p P cn- n
32	OF POOR QUALITY
equality constraints and a set of inequality constraints.
This problem may be solved by transforming it into a
nonlinear mathematical programming problem where a measure
of constraint violation is minimized with respect to the
design vector. The subproblem's own response (RO ij) is then
constituted of the minimum measure of constraint violation
as well as derivatives indicating the sensitivity of that
minimum measure to changes in the controls imposed on the
subproblem.
The subproblem on the highest level of the hierarchy
drives the whole design process. It selects its own design
variables so as to optimize the overall problem performance
index and satisfy its own constraints. It adjusts its
controls (CO 11) to improve the responses from the lower
levels (RI 11), that is, reduce the constraint violation in
the lower level subproblems.
3.2 	 LOWEST LEVEL SUBPROBLEM
Figure 2 a) describes symbolically subproblem lj, a
subproblem on the lowest level of the hierarchy. The vector
of design variables is X lj, the subproblem design is
influenced by the controls collected in vector CI lj and the
subproblem response is vector RO lj.	The subproblem

The functions g lj and elj are vector-valued. The subproblem
design is subject to a set of inequality constraints (Eq.
3.1.a). These are the constraints set on the corresponding
subsystem in the statement of the overall non-decomposed
problem. The design is also subject to a set of equality
constraints (Eq. 3.1.b). Some of these may come from the
formulation of the overall non-decomposed problem; some are
imposed on the subproblem during decomposition. The
multilevel decomposition consists of different models of the
system being designed, the models becoming more refined as
one progresses down the hierarchy. The equality constraints
arise from the necessity of requiring consistency between
the models at different levels. Also, some upper and lower
bounds may be set on the variables (Eq. 3.1.c). As stated
in the previous section, the subproblem is assumed to be
controlled by each subproblem on the higher levels. As a
result, the vector of controls CI lj is functionally
dependent on the optimum designs of all the subproblems

where b is a positive constant. Each equality constraint is
replaced by two inequality constraints (Eq. 3.3.c). The
distance between these constraints (2n ij ) is forced to
remain positive because of Eq. 3.3.e and to decrease because
of the second term in the objective function. 	Each
inequality constraint is relaxed by the addition of variable
E: mechanism of that relaxation is described in Fig.
3, for a simple two-dimensional problem with one equality
and three inequality constraints, assuming that the equality
constraint is identically satisfied. The first term in the
objective function (Eq. 3.3.a) is defined so as to increase
Eli . A high positive value for Eli is quite acceptable as
it means that the selected design point is deep inside the
feasible domain, away from the constraint boundaries, and
that decreases the chances of obtaining infeasible designs
when the controls are perturbed. If the solution of Problem
3.3 is so that Eli z 0 and Ti lj = 0, then it solves Problem
3.1. If, on the other hand, we have Elj < 0 or Ti lj x 0,
then the resulting design is infeasible with respect to
Problem 3.1.
Constant b is added to the definition of the objective
function to control the importance attributed to violatingOF POOP: QJA i"d Y
the different constraints. A high value for b results in a
heavy penalty paid for violating equality constraints;
conversely, a low value for b makes the penalty for
violating inequality constraints more important, in relative
terms. In addition to adjusting b, it may prove appropriate
to scale variables E1j and n1j in order to make all
components of the constraint gradients of the same order of
magnitude.
Any nonlinear programming algorithm may be used to solve
Problem 3.3. 	This yields X lj, as well as a measure of
inequality constraint violation E1j and a measure of
equality constraint violation n1j. These are functionally
dependent on the controls CI 1j and, therefore, as indicated
by Eq. 3.2, on the optimum design variables of subproblems
on higher levels. Optimum sensitivity analysis may be used
to study the effect changes in higher level subproblem
variables have on the constraint violations for subproblem
lj.	Considering Â£1j, if all higher level subproblem
designs are perturbed, we have

extrapolations of the type of Eq. 3.4.b, their coefficients
being available from the responses RI ij.	They require
satisfaction of equality and inequality constraints in lower41	OF POOR QU ^4 9TY
level subproblems. Equation 3.4.b gives E pvij for u = l; a
more general expression is given at the end of this section.
The increment AX.. corresponds to the change of X ij with13
respect to the previous optimum design, or, the current
initial design, hence AX ij = Xij -Xij.	Constraints 3.7.f
are called move limits; they limit the changes in the
variables X.. to a fixed fraction S of the initial values ofij
these variables. This is done to preserve the validity of
the sensitivity-analysis-based linear extrapolations of Eqs.

investigate the effect that changes in higher level

However, we must also account for the changes in the lower

The highest level subproblem is depicted in Fig. 2 c). Its

overall problem objective while satisfying a set of
inequality constraints. In addition, the controls C 11 must
be manipulated according to RI 11(Eq. 3.12) so as to improve
the lower level subproblem constraint violations. Assuming
that the overall problem objective is to minimize F(X11)'
the subproblem statement is as follows.

This organization specifies that the algorithm progresses
top-down rather than bottom-up as suggested in Ref. 20. The
disadvantage of conducting the optimization as proposed here
is that the first iteration must be done without responses
from lower level subproblems. Therefore, that iteration may
be considered wasted as the first subproblem designs will
not have been obtained with full consideration for the
requirements from those lower level subproblems. However,
this negative effect will be somewhat tempered if the move
limits (Eqs. 3.8.h and 3.14.f) are kept for the subproblems
above the lowest level. The argument for proceeding top-
down is the need for accounting for changes in lower level
subproblem response inputs while optimizing a subproblem on
a given level (see term in ARI uV in Eq. 3.12). If
optimization were conducted bottom-up, the sensitivity
derivatives making up a subproblem RO VV would be calculated
for a given RIuv but would be used in a higher level
subproblem in the same iteration before new RI PVvalues were
generated, therefore making it impossible to calculate
ARI11V
If the decomposition involves only two levels, the
objection 	to	conducting 	the	optimization 	bottom-up
disappears as there is no ARI 	term to calculate. 	Butuv
then, there is little difference between top-down and50	 ORIGINAL P!a^`:^ r::

bottom-up optimization. It is only a matter of deciding
whether optimization will start at the top or at the bottom;
from that point, the optimizations of the different levels
follow always in the same sequence.
3.6	MOVE LIMIT SELECTION
The move limits of Problems 3.8 and 3.14 may be chosen on
the basis of experience, or, using the bound estimates of
Sec. 2.4. When optimization is conducted with fixed move
limits, it is observed that the design first progresses
steadily towards the optimum solution but does not settle;
rather, it oscillates about that solution. During these
oscillations, an excessive number of switches in the active
constraint set occur, thereby preventing the process from
converging. This situation is similar to that observed when
solving a nonlinear mathematical programming problem as a
sequence of linearized problems. When that type of method
is used, similar oscillations are encountered if the optimum
of the initial problem does not lie at a vertex of the
feasible domain; the solutions of successive linear problems
oscillate between adjacent vertices of that domain. As
discussed by Pope (Ref. 27), an approach to overcome that
difficulty is to reduce the move limits as the oscillating
behavior appears. This approach was successfully followed
in this study.S1
3.7	FINAL COMMENTS
This chapter discusses an approach for optimizing decomposed
design problems. It must be emphasized that no firm rule is
established for devising a decomposition method. For a
specific problem, the decomposition must be made on the
basis of practical experience. As pointed out by Sobieski
(Ref. 20) the large design problems for which this type of
approach is conceived have always been treated in decomposed
form. For major projects, the design process is carried out
by the design office of a company (or even several
companies). 'That office is itself divided into specialty
groups and subgroups each of which handles the design of a
particular type of subsystem using its own codes and
analytic tools. 	The team managing the design is then
concerned with resolving the trade-offs. The proposed
method offers a means for doing this with a systematic
mathematical procedure; furthermore, it lends itself to
parallel or distributed computer processing.
Before applying the proposed method to a problem, the
decomposition must be defined. This implies a definition of
the different subproblems and the choice of their design
variables and constraints. The structure of the controls
must be identified as well. For the sake of generality, the
developments of this chapter make the assumption that each52
subproblem controls each lower level subproblem; as a
consequence, each subproblem responds to each higher level
subproblem. Clearly, this situation is undesirable from an
economic standpoint. An expensive item in the scheme
remains the calculation of the sensitivity derivatives, as
these require calculation of second-order behavioral
derivatives (Chap. 2). Therefore, as a general rule, the
number of controls should be kept as low as possible.
Practical experience should help in determining what control
or response must be accounted for. In particular, controls
or responses yielding typically low sensitivity derivatives
(aeij/aCIij	and aeij/aRIij	in Eq. 	3.10)	should be
ignored.
A key point of this discussion is the approach chosen for
finding individual subproblem designs (solution of Problems
3.1,	3.7,	and	3.13).	Two	additional variables 	are
introduced in each subproblem. 	These monitor the most
violated equality and inequality constraints. This
particular formulation was used because i) it permits
equality constraints to be treated numerically, and ii) it
is compatible with the use of a usable-feasible direction
algorithm for solving the individual subproblems. It must
be noted that other approaches could be used as well.
Reference 21 discusses an example based on a penaltyS3
N
function formulation, where a cumulative measure involving
all the constraints of the problem (except side constraints
and move limits) is minimized.Chapter IV
APPLICATION OF THE ALGORITHM TO THE DESIGN OF A
SAILPLANE WING
This chapter demonstrates the applicability of the proposed
algorithm to the problem of designing a high-performance
sailplane wing. To achieve this goal, we describe the
proposed decomposition. We identify the subproblems, their
design variables, and the different control and response
vectors. The objective of the overall problem is taken to
be the optimization of a classical performance index called
the cross-country speed. Clearly, to efficiently design an
airplane, one must optimize its entire configuration all at
once. However, in order to reduce the problem size, we
focus our efforts on the wing design, in effect solving the
problem of redesigning the wing of an existing sailplane.
We assume that the description of the other sailplane
components is entirely known. The variables of the overall
problem describe the wing shape and its structure. 	The
decomposition has four levels (see Fig. 4).
The top level of the hierarchy is occupied by a
subproblem that selects global performance parameters. This
drives an aerodynamic subproblem on the second level where
the wing shape is designed to the specified performance
characteristics. 	The synthesis of the wing structure is
54Figure 4: Four-level hierarchy for performance sailplane
wing design problem.OF POOR QU `^:,l17Y
done on the two lower levels. The third level deals with
the determination of spanwise distributions of global
structural characteristics, and the fourth level is
concerned with the detailed design of wing elements. The
subproblems are identified by the following subscripts: p
for performance subproblem, a for aerodynamic subproblem, g
for global structural subproblem, and lj for j_th local
structural subproblem. The developments were carried out to
a point where computer implementation is possible. 	The
details of the formulation are given in Apps. A-D.
4.1	PERFORMANCE SUBPROBLEM
A performance subproblem occupies the highest level of the
hierarchy, and it drives the whole design process. Its task
is to select a combination of performance parameters which
maximize the sailplane's cross-country speed. The cross-
country speed is defined as the average speed the sailplane
achieves over a typical flight segment. It is shown in App.
A that the variables entering the calculation of that
performance index are: the sailplane gross weight (W), its
planform area (S), the coefficients (C DO' CD1' CD2) of a
performance curve called the drag polar, and the maximum
lift coefficient (CLmax). These variables will be taken as
the performance variables.
T
X 	â‚¬W'S'C DO' C Dl' CD2'CLmax} 	(4.1)57
OF poc;k Qu >;.;,''y'J
The design will be subjected to the constraint that the
sailplane be capable of a minimum rate of climb in a typical
thermal updraft. The variables may be divided into two
groups. On the one hand, the weight selected on the basis
of performance considerations controls the structural design
by determining the amount of structural material available.
On the other hand, the remaining variables (referred to as
aerodynamic performance variables) control the aerodynamic
design by specifying the aerodynamic characteristics
required from the wing. This is, of course, a statement
that optimization of an airplane entails carefully
integrated aerodynamic and structural designs. The control
outputs of the performance subproblem are therefore the
performance variables themselves.

4.2	AERODYNAMIC SUBPROBLEM
The wing is narrow, unswept, and twisted, and it has a
double taper (see Fig. 14). 	Its airfoil is chosen from a
standard catalog which details its parameters. 	The
objective of the aerodynamic subproblem is the selection of58

the wing geometry which corresponds to the values of
planform area, drag polar coefficients and maximum lift
coefficient specified in the performance subproblem (these
will be referred to as target aerodynamic performance
variables). As detailed in App. B, the aerodynamic
variables include the wing semispan (b) and the spanwise
position of the taper change (b b). Also included among the
variables are the section chord at the root, break, and tip
(cr,cb,ct), the section maximum thickness at the root,
break, and tip (t r,tb,tt), and, finally, the wing twist
angle at the break and the tip ( Eb,Et). Hence,
Xa = 2 b,bbfcr'Cb,Ct,tr,tb,tt,Eb,EtS	(4.3)
Once these variables are known, it is possible to calculate
the resulting wing aerodynamic performance variables. By
requiring that these must equal the target values specified
in the performance subproblem, we obtain six equality
constraints among the components of X a. Furthermore, one
inequality constraint is added which forces the initiation
of stall at an inboard wing section. As explained in App.
B, the calculation of sailplane aerodynamic performance
characteristics takes into account the effect of the
Reynolds number, and therefore, the sailplane weight must be
known. The vector of control inputs into the aerodynamic59	OF POUR Q'U'A {T1(
subproblem includes then the target values for the
aerodynamic performance characteristics and also the
sailplane weight.
CI  = X 	 (4.4)
The aerodynamic design controls the structural design
through two major elements: the wing shape and the
aerodynamic loads. The former determines the root bending
moment as well as the size of the load bearing part of the
section; 	the	latter	clearly	influences 	the	total
distribution of loads. All the aerodynamic variables are
required for calculating the wing shape and the aerodynamic
loads, therefore
CO  = X 	 (4.5)
Finally,the vector of response outputs from the aerodynamic
subproblem is given by Eq. 3.11.

The sailplane gross weight was specified in the performance

components is fixed, the weight allocated to the wing (the
target weight) is known. At this level, the wing is modeled
as a straight beam. This subproblem objective is the
selection of global wing structural characteristics, that
is: the spanwise distributions of weight per unit length,
bending and torsional stiffnesses. 	These are written as
superpositions of interpolating polynomials, the
coefficients of which are taken as the subproblem design
variables and are referred to as wing stiffnesses (see App.
C),
XT _ { wo,...,wn	EIoI...,EIn ,GJo,...,GJn 	 (4.7)
s	 s	 s
The compatibility between w j, EIj and GJ j is enforced at the
lowest level when the detailed synthesis forces the element
designs to match the global level stiffnesses. The design
is subjected to one equality constraint that specifies that
the total wing weight equals the target weight selected in
the performance subproblem. 	In addition, 	two global
structural inequality constraints are added. 	The wing
bending displacements must be limited, and its torsional
divergence speed must exceed a given minimum. The
calculation of these constraints requires the wing shape, a
number of aerodynamic load parameters and, of course, the
target weight. The wing shape (vector H) is a function of61
OF Poor,
the aerodynamic variables, while the target weight (W) is a
function of the performance variables. The aerodynamic load
parameters (vector A) are themselves functions of the wing
shape and the sailplane weight as shown in App. B. Hence,
the vector of control inputs into the subproblem is	
CI TT =W(Xp),HT(Xa),AT(Xa,W(Xp M	 (4.8)
The choice of the wing stiffnesses controls the design of
the details of structure, hence

4.4	LOCAL STRUCTURAL SUBPROBLEMS
The fourth level of the hierarchy is devoted to designing
the details of the wing to match the stiffness distributions
chosen by the global level subproblem. To achieve this, the
wing is divided into n  constant property elements (see Fig.OF POOR QUALITY
22), each of which is designed in a separate subproblem.
The design variables describing one element include the
cross-sectional dimensions of the spar caps (a,t c), the
thicknesses of the sandwich panels constituting the leading
and trailing edge shells (tf,tfs) and the spar webs
(tw,tfw), and the rib spacing (d). Hence,
T
Xlj = a j,tcj,tsj,tfsj,twj,tfwj,dj1	 (4.11)
The variables are subjected to three equality constraints
insuring that the element stiffnesses equal the target
values (vector Kj) specified at the global structural level.
Furthermore, it is required that the elements withstand
applied end loads (vector Mj) without failure or local
buckling. App. D shows that the calculation of the
stiffnesses involves the element gross dimensions (vector
Hj); these are functions of the aerodynamic variables.
Also, the applied end loads (Mj) computation must be based
on the vector describing the wing shape (H), a function of
the aerodynamic variables, the vector of aerodynamic load
parameters (A), a function of aerodynamic variables and
weight, and the global structural variables (X g) to account
for the effect of inertia loads. Hence,

This decomposition conforms to the general form defined in
Chap. III; in particular, it does not contain reverse or
network controls. This is because the following effects are
neglected (see Apps. B and C): i) effect of wing
flexibility on aerodynamic characteristics, ii) effect of
changes in wing section elastic axis position on torsional
divergence speed, and, iii) effect of changes in wing
section center of gravity position on inertia-force-induced
torque. To account for i), one must include reverse
controls between the global structural and aerodynamic
subproblems. Effects ii) and iii) require reverse controls
between local structural and global structural subproblems.OF POOR 	 E' `Y
Chapter V
TWO-LEVEL MINIMUM WEIGHT WING DESIGN
A complete numerical application of the algorithm presented
in Chap. III is appropriate, but it was decided that
computer implementation of the four-level high-performance
sailplane design problem formulated in Chap. IV and Apps.
A-D would be a task well beyond the scope of this research.
A more limited and manageable but still significant
application of the algorithm is the minimum weight design of
the sailplane wing. This corresponds to the two lower
levels of the hierarchy described by Fig. 4, except that the
objective function of the overall problem, and therefore of
the top level of the decomposed problem, is now the total
wing weight. The global structural subproblem now has the
form of Problem 3.13. 	The objective function (F(X11)
F(X9)) is the weight, and there are three inequality
constraints (g11(X11) g9(X9)); two set upper and lower
limits on the wing tip displacement, one provides a lower
bound for the wing torsional divergence speed (see App. C).
The weight and stiffness distributions are Lagrangian
interpolations defined on five equal length intervals (ns =
5), thereby requiring six coefficients per distribution, for
a total of eighteen global level variables (X 9). The five
6768	OF POOR QUAU -n ^
local structural subproblems are formulated as in Problem
3.1. Each one is described by seven design variables (Xlj ).
The vector of constraints (glj(Xlj)) contains twelve
constraints on stresses, five on buckling (only the buckling
of the sandwich panels is considered, that of the spar caps
is ignored, see App. D). Also three constraints are
included which limit the ratios of spar cap width to element
chord and of sandwich panel total thickness to face sheet
thickness (see App. E). Finally, three equality constraints
(e1j(X1j)) require that the element weight per unit length,
bending and torsional stiffnesses equal the target values
specified at the global structural level (see App. D).
The multilevel decomposition for this two-level problem
corresponds to the two lower levels of the hierarchy of Fig.
4 except that the definition of the wing planform is now
assumed fixed so that the vectors of wing shape (H) and
element gross shape (H j) are constant throughout the
optimization. Furthermore, the effect of the sailplane
weight (W(X P)) on the aerodynamic parameters is ignored so
that vector A is constant as well. The control inputs into
local structural subproblem lj (CI lj) are then the vectors
of target stiffnesses (Kj) and end loads (M.). The response
outputs from that subproblem are given by Eq. 4.13, without
the sensitivity derivative with respect to H.. The responseOF POOR QjA- i -T Y
inputs into the global structural subproblem are given by
Eq. 4.14 where the participation factor Tlg is set to unity
as the global structural subproblem is the only one that
controls the local structural level subproblems. The
numerical values of the parameters needed for the
calculations of Apps. A-D are given in App. E.
5.1	 TEST DESCRIPTION
Two test cases will be described. The first starts from the
feasible domain, all the constraints being satisfied with
ample margins. 	The second starts from the infeasible
domain. It is such that, at the global level, the tip
displacement exceeds its upper limit by 130%, while the
divergence dynamic pressure is 10% below its lower limit.
With the exception of the tip element, all the wing elements
have a large proportion of stress and buckling constraints
violated, resulting in measures of inequality constraint
violation (E lj) ranging from -3.0 to -6.0. In both cases,
an initial design was given for each wing element and the
stiffnesses of these elements were calculated. Trial and
error was then used to determine the global level
stiffnesses whose averages would yield back the local level
stiffnesses just calculated, in accordance with Eq. C.23.3.

Figure 5 gives the convergence history for the test
cases. Both optimizations took 28 iterations 3 to produce a
feasible design with a stabilized weight of 1030 N. (for two
wings), with the differences in the final values being less
than 1%. The design started in the feasible domain achieves
a weight reduction of 68%. That begun in the infeasible
region gains barely 6% of weight as it redistributes the
structural material in an attempt to satisfy the violated
constraints. Both final solutions have the divergence
constraint critical, while the upper displacement constraint
is satisfied with a margin of about 25%. The designs of
wing elements 1 (inboard), 2 and 4 are critical or near
critical (-.01 5 e S .07), while those of elements 3 and 5
(outboard) are not (e > .10). The active constraints for
the critical elements are: i) the stress constraints in the
carbon fiber spar caps, and primarily in the lower one, ii)
the shear buckling constraint for the upper and lower
sandwich panels of the trailing edge shell and the rear spar
web, iii) the constraint setting an upper limit on the spar
cap width to section chord ratio (a/c). 	Furthermore, for
each element, the rib spacing d is against its upper limit,
3 Unless otherwise specified, one iteration corresponds to
one complete optimization of the overall problem. It
entails one optimization of the global structural
subproblem, one optimization and one sensitivity analysis
for each local structural subproblem.72	 ORIGINAL PAC 12 !S

while the spar web face sheet thickness is against its lower
limit.	The parameter b in the local level subproblem
objective function (Problem 3.3) was set to 100. At the
global level, the objective function parameters (c and d,
see Problem 3.14) were chosen so that, at the beginning of
each global level optimization, the penalty term in the
objective function (-cÂ£11+dell) was ten times the weight
(F(X11)). As a consequence, all equality constraints were
satisfied, after most system iteration, to within 1%, or
less (n !- .O1).

initial and final designs of both tests. The same
information is given for the bending stiffnesses on Fig. 7.
On these figures, the straight-line segments join
stiffnesses corresponding to the same (initial/final)
design; they do not represent the global level stiffness
distributions, as these are obtained with Lagrangian
interpolations and have no slope discontinuities. The
figures show good agreement between the final target values
(open symbols) toward the wing root, and the agreement
worsens somewhat toward the wing tip. The variability is

(solid symbols). This is probably evidence that the optimum
is fairly "flat". In other words, the global level design
may be perturbed without drastically changing the overall
design quality measured in terms of minimum objective
function and constraint satisfaction. Three factors may be
contributing to that situation. First, due to the
relationship between the number of coefficients in the
global level wing model (6 per distribution of weight per
unit length, bending and torsional stiffnesses) and the
number of wing elements (5), there is an infinite number of
global level designs which yield the same local level target
values. Second, it may be proven algebraically that all the
combinations of global level weights which result in the
same local level target weights actually result in the same
total wing weight (this can be shown easily for Lagrangian
interpolations based on an odd number of equal length
intervals). Third, all the global level constraints (in the
untransformed subproblem) are integral constraints (see App.
C). The integration process should be expected to smooth
out the effect of variations in global level stiffness
distributions.
The distributions of stiffnesses are wavy; this must be
related to the order of the interpolating polynomials used
to model them. These polynomials are of the fifth order in7 6	GFEX L PAC-2 713
Our POOR Q'UAZATY
the present model. 	It would be interesting to model the
wing weight and stiffness distributions with lower-order
polynomials; this should reduce the wavyness while
necessitating fewer variables in the global structural
subproblem and making the global and local structural models
independent. This would, however, require a new definition
of the relationship between the global level weights and
stiffnesses and the corresponding local level target values
(Eq. C.23).
Table 1 compares numerically the initial and final
designs for the inboard and outboard elements. As expected,
the trend observed among the target stiffnesses is repeated
at the lower level; the two designs obtained for the inboard
wing element are very close, while those for the outboard
element differ substantially. This general trend can be
intuitively understood as the overall wing response must be
more sensitive to the design of the wing root which carries
the total wing load than to that of the wing tip which is
almost unloaded.

element when optimization is started from the infeasible
domain.	A short digression is necessary to explain the
physical meaning of variables E and n. For an infeasible
design, E measures the violation of the most violated
constraint; for a feasible design it gives an indication of
the margin associated with the constraint which is the
closest to being critical. For example, if we refer to a
design problem involving a single inequality constraint on
displacement u (g(X) = u(X)/u max- 1 5 0), a value of -1.5 for
E indicates that displacement u exceeds its maximum value
umax by 150%, while a value of 0.5 means that the
displacement is only 50% of its upper limit. 	Variable n
measures the violation of the most violated equality
constraint of a subproblem. Considering a subproblem
subjected to the requirement that a function f of its design
variables remain equal to a target value f t (e(X) _
f(X)/ft-1 = 0), a value of .25 for n means that f(X) is 25%
away from ft.
Returning to Fig. 8, the solid lines give the evolution
Of E12 and n12. They describe the evolution of these
optimum quantities throughout the design process, each value
being obtained at the end of a complete optimization of

interpretation of the graph may be aided by an example. At
the end of iteration 3 1	E12 is -1.3S; 	the global
structural subproblem improves its design at the beginning
of iteration 4 and predicts that this will result in a
change to -.68 while E12 actually is reduced to -.78 when
local structural subproblem 12 is optimized.
From Fig. 8, one can observe that the algorithm
effectively reduces the violation of inequality constraints
while keeping the violation of equality constraints within
1%, most of the time. The success is a result of the
generally good prediction of these measures by the global
structural 	subproblem. 	Occasionally, 	however, 	the
predictions are poor, as for iterations 6, 22 and 24 for
E12, and 10 for T) 12*	The bad predictions can be
correlated with changes in the set of constraints
determining the successive solutions to subproblem 12; as
discussed in Sec. 2.4, these changes do introduce
discontinuities in the sensitivity derivatives. This slows
down the convergence process, but the algorithm appears
robust enough to overcome the difficulty; this observation
is consistent with the results of Ref. 21. It must be noted81	 ORICI"1,11 PAGE IS
OF POOR Q'. AL117Y
that the occurrence of active constraint switching does not
always produce discontinuities as significant as those
observed here. As a matter of fact, about 60% of the
optimizations included in the example presented end with
changes in the active constraint set, but only 15% seem
really affected by the change.
5.4 	 ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
As was pointed out in Chap. III, limits must be set on the
global level variables to insure that the sensitivity-
derivative-based linear extrapolations of the local level
measures of constraint violation are not used beyond their
range of validity. 	Upper and lower bounds could be
estimated for these limits, using Eqs. 2.25 and 2.16.
However, it was elected not to do so in this study. The two
test cases presented here were started with move limits
allowing changes of Â± 10% in the global level variables at
each iteration of the overall problem (b = .10 in Eq.
3.13.f). As the process neared the optimum solution, these
limits were reduced as discussed in Sec. 3.6. For example,
in the test case started from the infeasible starting point,
the move limits were kept at 10% during the first 5
iterations, 5% for iterations 6-21, 2.5% for iterations
22-25, and finally, 1% for the last three iterations. 	It82	 ORI4ti-I'A PACE a
OF POOR QUALf r
must be pointed out that no attempt was made to refine the
bound selection strategy nor to identify the widest usable
bounds for the first steps of the process. Doing so could
probably improve the convergence characteristics of the
algorithm.
The impact of active constraint switching on the rate of
convergence is related to the specifics of the solution of
the individual subproblems. This approach tracks the most
violated equality and inequality constraints. Therefore, a
relatively large number of changes in the active constraint
set may be expected. By contrast, the approach of Ref. 21
combines most constraints (except upper and lower bounds and
move limits) in a penalty function which is continuous in
the constraints. That approach should not result in so many
changes. The question of which approach provides the best
rate of convergence may be answered only by using both
approaches to solve the same design problem.
Early tests with this algorithm revealed a situation that
deserves comment. In some circumstances, the subproblem
solution may not be unique. An example of this is depicted
on Fig. 9 where the subproblem involves one equality
constraint that is parallel to one of the sides of the
domain defined by the inequality constraints. Assuming that
the equality constraint is satisfied at the outset of the91 +

optimization, we see that each point of segment AB is a
solution. This situation does not cause difficulties
during optimization of the subproblem. However, it leads to
singular sensitivity matrices. 	This can be shown on the
example. As none of the subproblem objective function
(e-E+bn) or active constraints depend on variables x 2, the
corresponding row and column of the sensitivity equations
(Eq. 2.14) are identically zero. This difficulty may be
overcome by eliminating the null row and column from the
equation. In this problem, the situation appeared when the
design process was started with all variables at lower
bounds.
To conclude this chapter, a few words about the
implementation are in order. A special purpose FORTRAN
computer program was developed to carry out the examples
described. It was run in batch on an IBM 3081 processor.
Three iterations were run at a time and results from
successive iterations were kept on a direct access data file
so as to provide the capability for restarting the
optimization from any iteration. 	Individual subproblems
were optimized with the usable-feasible direction algorithm
implemented in subroutine CONMIN (Ref. 28). 	For the two
examples discussed, 	convergence was 	achieved in 28
iterations; a typical iteration took 30-35 CPU seconds. Of85
that time, about 60% was devoted to optimizing the global
structural subproblem, while the remaining 40% was split
evenly between optimization and sensitivity analysis of the
5 local level subproblems. During one iteration of the
overall problem, optimization of the global level subproblem
took an average of 18 iterations to converge. Each global
level iteration required about 21 function evaluations
(weight, wing tip displacement and wing divergence dynamic
pressure). At the local level, a wing element design took
an average of 38 iterations. 	Each local level iteration
required about 11 function evaluations (stiffnesses,
stresses and buckling constraints), while each local level
sensitivity analysis required 531 function evaluations. The
numbers of function evaluations reported above include those
required for derivative calculations. For reasons of
convenience, all derivatives for optimization were obtained
by forward difference formulae, those for sensitivity
analysis were found by central difference formulae.0!r^aJliY9 :liA- i

DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This work centers on a multilevel decomposition approach to
the optimization of large problems. The starting point is
Sobieski's original idea (Ref. 20) of using optimum
sensitivity analysis to account for the coupling between the
different subproblems of a decomposed problem. The
objective of this research was the investigation of the
applicability of Sobieski's algorithm to the design of
complex engineering systems. The three major contributions
of this dissertation are: i) a presentation of an extended
version of the algorithm, ii) an illustration of the
applicability of the algorithm to a realistic
multidisciplinary design problem, and, iii) an application
of the proposed algorithm. This chapter summarizes these
developments and offers some recommendations.
6.1	ON THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM
The algorithm we developed is very general; in contrast with
previously introduced multilevel approaches, it does not
make restrictive assumptions as to the mathematical nature
of the problem considered nor is it developed for a specific
class of physical problems. Rather, it is devised for the
8687
optimization of large systems which may be decomposed into
subsystems.
We hypothesize an existing decomposition of the overall
problem into smaller subproblems. It is assumed that the
decomposition is multilevel and hierarchical; that is, the
subproblems are organized on levels corresponding to
progressively more refined models of the system designed
and, furthermore, the subproblems on a given level exert
control on the design of the subproblems on lower levels.
The controls must be defined with the hierarchy. It is
finally assumed that the subproblems entail finding a design
that satisfies a set of equality and inequality constraints.
An iterative procedure is then used where each subproblem
is designed separately by minimization of a measure of
constraint violation, for fixed values of the controls
imposed by higher level subproblems. Sensitivity
derivatives of the resulting subproblem solution are
generated which constitute the response of that subproblem
to the higher level subproblem controls. Each subproblem is
designed with additional constraints which require
improvement of the lower level subproblem responses. This
algorithm specifically allows for the extreme situation
where a subproblem controls each lower level subproblem,
and, as a consequence, each subproblem responds to each88	 ORIGINAL PAGE' M
OF POOR QUALITY
N
higher level subproblem. The highest level of the hierarchy
is occupied by a single subproblem which drives the whole
design process. Its task is the optimization of the overall
problem objective with respect to variables which describe
the system in very general terms. This subproblem also
manipulates its controls to improve the lower level
subproblem designs.
The specifics of the solution of the individual
subproblems differ from those of Ref. 21, where equality
constraints are handled analytically by elimination of
dependent variables, while the independent variables are
found by minimization of a penalty function. The present
approach introduces two additional variables which measure
i) the violation of the most violated inequality constraint
(or the margin of the constraints which are the closest to
being critical), and ii) the violation of the most violated
equality constraint. These variables are then combined in a
cumulative measure of violation which is minimized to find
the "best" subproblem design. The advantage of this
approach is that it is more general in that it handles
equality constraints numerically. Furthermore, it is
compatible with the use of a usable-feasible direction
algorithm.ORIGINAL PAGE IS

This discussion shows that when the decomposition
contains more than two levels, it becomes necessary to
consider the sensitivity of a given subproblem above the
lowest level not only to the control inputs into that
subproblem, as shown in Ref. 20, but also to the response
inputs into that subproblem, as well as to the initial
design for that subproblem. Of course, it may be argued
that ignoring such effects will only slow down the
convergence of the overall process while resulting in fewer
sensitivity analyses and in an easier implementation. This
question must be resolved by testing a simple three-level
problem for which a solution is known or easy to generate.
All that is required before using this algorithm is a
choice of the decomposition of the overall problem into
subproblems, and of the .controls between the subproblems.
These choices must be made on the basis of practical
experience accumulated with the type of systems considered.
The decomposition must correspond to the general description
given above. Intuitively, the number of controls should be
kept to a minimum; the decision of whether to include a
specific control or not could be helped by analysis of the
sensitivity of the optimum of the subproblem being
controlled to the control considered.90

6.2	ON THE APPLICABILITY OF THE ALGORITHM
The applicability of the algorithm was illustrated by
formulation of a realistic multidisciplinary design problem:
the simultaneous aerodynamic and structural design of
sailplane wing for maximum cross-country speed. A
multilevel decomposition conforming to the desired general
form was developed. 	The highest level is occupied by a
subproblem 	which	selects	the	sailplane 	performance
parameters that maximize the cross-country speed. Then
follows an aerodynamic subproblem which determines the wing
shape that produces the aerodynamic performance parameters
selected at the level above and meets a stall-related
constraint. 	On the third level, a global structural
subproblem chooses the distributions of wing weight and
stiffnesses which satisfy constraints on wing tip
displacement and divergence dynamic pressure for a total
weight equal to that selected in the performance subproblem.
Finally, at the lowest level, a number of structural
subproblems are concerned with finding wing element designs
which yield the stiffnesses specified by the global
structural subproblem while satisfying stress and buckling
constraints.
The controls of this decomposition were chosen by
considering the rigorous functional dependence of a given91
subproblem optimum on the variables of the higher level
subproblems. As a consequence, the weight, a performance
variable, controls all subproblems below the highest level;
likewise, the wing shape vector, a combination of
aerodynamic variables, controls the two structural levels.
This underscores the need for an algorithm that allows each
subproblem to control each lower level subproblem.
The formulation of this design problem was carried to a
point where computer implementation is possible. Its
completion can prove to be a very instructive exercise,
especially as -:.he initial theoretical developments related
to the proposed algorithm show that handling problems with
more than two levels may require calculations that were not
necessary for two-level problems.
6.3	ON THE EXAMPLE PROBLEM
The proposed algorithm has been applied to the two-level
minimum weight design of the sailplane wing. The tests show
that it is effective at producing low weight feasible
designs whether optimization is started from the feasible
domain or the infeasible one.
The numerical experiments conducted confirm that as
optimization progresses, changes occur in the sets of
constraints 	defining 	the	optima	of	the	different92
subproblems. These changes occasionally cause
discontinuities in the sensitivity derivatives, and these
may even result in oscillations about the optimum solution.
Although the algorithm successfully overcomes these
discontinuities, they still result in delayed convergence.
The susceptibility of a particular algorithm to active
constraint switching depends on the specific approach used
to optimize the individual subproblems. This point should
be investigated carefully prior to undertaking any large-
scale implementation of the algorithm. A good basis for
comparison could be obtained by solving a small two-level
problem using all candidate subproblem formulations.REFERENCES

PERFORMANCE SUBPROBLEM
The design of an airplane is always driven by the desire to
obtain the best possible value of a given performance index.
In this application, we will maximize the sailplane best
cross-country speed, that is, maximize the best average
speed the sailplane can achieve over a segment of flight
which starts with a high-speed glide and follows with a
circling climb in a thermal to recover the height lost
during the glide. In addition, we will require that the
sailplane achieves a minimum rate of climb in a typically
weak thermal. 	The design variables optimized in this
subproblem are the sailplane weight, wing area, maximum lift
coefficient, 	and	the	parameters 	relating 	its	drag
coefficient to its lift coefficient.
This appendix describes the calculations required to
obtain the sailplane best cross-country speed and rate of
climb as required for the optimization of the performance
subproblem.

A.2	SAILPLANE PERFORMANCE CURVES
A.2.1	Drag Polar
The performance of a sailplane in gliding flight may be
described by a curve that relates total drag coefficient to
total lift coefficient. That curve is named the drag polar,
it is essentially parabolic in shape; we will assume the
following form
where the coefficients CDO, CD1 and CD2 depend mainly on the
sailplane aerodynamic design and on its weight.
A.2.2	Speed Polar
As a sailplane flies unaccelerated on a straight trajectory
in undisturbed air the lift and the drag combined
equilibrate exactly the weight (see Fig. 10). The
similarity between the triangles of speeds and forces yields	
vs/V = D/L = CD/CL	(A.2)

This equation is the speed polar. It is quite important to
the sailplane pilot since it allows him to know the altitude

speed.

A sailplane circling at constant speed in undisturbed air is
depicted in Fig. 11. 	It flies on a helical trajectory of
constant radius r about a vertical axis. In the plane of
symmetry of the sailplane, the similarity between the
triangles of speeds and forces yields
vsc/V = D/L = C D/CL	(A.10)

the sailplane, we see that the vertical rate of sink v sc is

coefficient selected by the pilot.
A.3	A SAILPLANE PERFORMANCE INDEX: THE CROSS-COUNTRY SPEED
A.3.1	Soaring
A sailplane is usually towed to altitude by another
airplane, a winch or even a car. If the pilot encounters
only motionless air, he will trade his altitude for the
speed needed to sustain flight. To keep his altitude and
really soar, the pilot must find regions of rising air.
Three soaring techniques are frequently used: thermal
soaring, ridge soaring and wave soaring (See Ref. 29).
In thermal soaring, the source of lift (lift is meant
here as upward force) is columns of rising air. During
sunny days, radiation from the sun heats the surface of the
earth which, in turn, heats the air in contact with it. The
heating of the air is conditioned by the nature of the
underlying surface. By buoyancy, the warmer air rises with
respect to the cooler air. The regions of rising air areORIGINAL Rk,C^:7 -
107 	OF POOR QUAUT
called thermals. Once a pilot finds a thermal, he usually
tries to circle in it to gain altitude.
When the wind blows on a mountain ridge, it is deflected
upwards. By flying in a direction generally parallel to the
ridge, on its upwind side, the pilot can remain at about
constant altitude for as long as the ridge is uninterrupted,
provided it is reasonably straight. This is called ridge
soaring. The maximum altitude achievable in ridge lift is
only a few hundred meters over the mountain.
When a mass of air flows across a mountain top, a system
of standing waves may develop downwind from the ridge.
Regions of rising and descending air alternate. Those
regions may extend very high in altitude, up to ten times
the height of the ridge. This source of lift is always used
to establish altitude records. 	This type of flying is
referred to as wave soaring.
From this very brief discussion of soaring, it is clear
that a sailplane may be flown at quite different flight
regimes. Therefore, it is difficult to define a performance
index for the design of a sailplane without making some
assumptions as to the type of soaring it will be used for.
In this work, we will design the sailplane for thermal
soaring.

A.3.2	The Cross-Country Speed
To cover a given distance, a pilot alternates slow circling
flight in thermals with fairly fast glides between thermals.
A portion of such a flight is sketched on Fig. 12. It
includes a glide in a region of air descending at constant
speed with' The sailplane flies at horizontal speed V, its
rate of sink with respect to the surrounding air is v s, it
covers the distance d in a time t 1, losing height h. The
sailplane then reaches a thermal assumed to have the shape
of a vertical cylinder. The pilot begins circling flight,
and the height h is recovered in the thermal in a time t2.
The rate of climb in the thermal is obtained by combining
the sailplane rate of sink in circling flight v sc with the
rate of climb of the thermal air wi th which is assumed to
depend on the distance r between the sailplane and the
thermal axis,
vc = vth(r)-vsc	(A.19)
The cross-country speed is defined as the distance covered
divided by the time required to reach the thermal and
recover the altitude lost.

The concept of cross-country speed was first introduced by
K. Temmes (Ref. 30). It has been the starting point for a
large number of investigations in the areas of sailplane
design and flight strategy (see Refs. 31-33 for example).
A.3.3	Flight Strategy
Aside from keeping his sailplane as aerodynamically clean as
possible, there are three major actions that a sailplane
pilot may take to improve his cross-country speed for given
atmospheric conditions.
i)Achieve the best rate of climb in the thermal.
Intuitively, the best value of V cc will be obtained
with the best rate of climb in thermals v 	Thec
pilot must carefully select his position in the
thermal to obtain the best possible lift.
ii)Select the best interthermal speed. 	From the
development on the speed polar (Eq. A.9), we know111
that the rate of sink in straight flight v s is
directly related to the horizontal flight speed V.
For a given interthermal downdraft vith and a given
anticipated achieved rate of climb, the pilot is
left with the choice of the horizontal speed.
Intuitively, if the next thermal is expected to be
strong, the pilot should dive toward it at high
speed. This may cause him to lose a lot of
altitude in interthermal flight, but that loss will
be recovered quickly in the strong thermal, and the
cross-country speed will be high. Alternatively,
if the pilot anticipates a weak thermal, he should
choose a slow speed in interthermal flight.
Adjust the sailplane weight. To increase the
weight of a sailplane alters its speed polar in
such a way that a given rate of sink occurs at a
higher horizontal flight speed. This is favorable
in interthermal flight. However, the price to pay
for that is a lower achievable rate of climb in a
given thermal. It turns out that heavy weight is
advantageous in typical strong thermal conditions
but disadvantageous in typical weak conditions.
Therefore, sailplanes are equipped with water tanks
(water ballasts) in the wings. 	The pilot may112 	 apryja ''' !AL 'PÂ° - G IS

select the amount of water to carry on the basis of
the thermal conditions for the flight.
In the next two subsections, we will discuss how to
evaluate the best achievable rate of climb for a sailplane
in a given thermal and the best cross-country speed for
fixed rate of climb and interthermal downdraft.
A.4	BEST RATE OF CLIMB IN THERMAL FLIGHT
A.4.1	Thermal Model
A difficulty in any study of sailplane performance is the
choice of the thermal model. We will follow Carmichael
(Ref. 31) and assume the thermals to be cylinders with
vertical axes. 	The distribution of vertical airspeed is

These equations are nonlinear and must be solved

Experiments with typical sailplane parameters have shown
that the solution may yield an unrealistically high lift

AERODYNAMIC SUBPROBLEM
The objective of the aerodynamic subproblem is to design the
wing so as to obtain the aerodynamic characteristics
requested by the performance subproblem. These
characteristics are the wing area, the coefficients of the
drag polar, and the maximum sailplane lift coefficient. The
design is subjected to the constraint that stall must begin
at an inboard station of the wing so as to preserve lateral
control in high angle of attack conditions. The variables
of this subproblem are coefficients of the spanwise
distributions of wing chord, thickness and geometric twist.
The calculations of the contribution of the wing to the
aerodynamic characteristics will be performed using accurate
prediction methods since the wing design is the object of
this subproblem. In particular, finite span and Reynolds
number effects will be accounted for while estimating wing
lift and drag (as suggested in 34). However, the wing will
be assumed rigid, neglecting aeroelastic lift redistribution
and similar phenomena. The effect of the remaining
sailplane components on the aerodynamic characteristics of
interest will be found using more approximate methods. This
will enable us to keep the computational cost to a minimum

the sailplane polar curve, its maximum lift coefficient and
for estimating the position of the wing station where stall

B.2.2	Airfoil Description
In the past thirty years, sailplane wings have been built
with specially tailored, laminar-flow airfoils (see Ref.
35). However, for this application, we will use airfoils
from the NACA 6-series, a class typical of immediate post
World War II sailplane design. This choice was conditioned
by the availability of experimental data. 	The specific127	OR9atNAL PAGE `5
OF POOR QUALITY
airfoil family chosen is the NACA 64-4XX which is
extensively described in Ref. 36. For the purpose of this
application, linear regressions were developed from the data
collected in Ref. 36. These laws relate the airfoil
performance characteristics to their thickness ratio (t/c)
and the Reynolds number based on the chord (Re=Vc/v). The
data from Ref. 36 is valid for the following ranges of
thickness ratio and Reynolds number
09<t/c<.18 and 630000<Re<6300000	(B.8)
Typical Reynolds number for sailplanes may be as low as
400000; therefore, the laws are somewhat deficient.
However, no sufficient set of data was found for Reynolds
numbers less than 630000.
The following performance laws are used (see Fig. 15).

B.3	LIFT AND AERODYNAMIC MOMENT CALCULATION
B.3.1	Wing Lift
The three-dimensional spanwise distribution of lift
coefficient may be obtained by integration of Prandtl's
lifting line equation. This classical integral equation is
developed in Refs. 37 and 38 where it is said to be
applicable to straight, high aspect ratio wings in
imcompressible flow. Several solution schemes exist for
Prandtl's equation. We will use Glauert's method, which is
based on Fourier series.
A new coordinate is defined along the wing by
m = cos - 1(y/b)	 (B.15)
where the angle 0 varies between 0 at the wing tip and n/2
at the wing root. Stations are chosen along the semispan at
equal interval Am. If there are n  intervals
a^ = Tr/ ( 2na )	(B.16)
The three-dimensional lift coefficient (c l) at an
arbitrary section along the wing is given by

B.3.4	Maximum Lift Coefficient
The information obtained in the previous sections may be
used to estimate approximately the sailplane maximum lift
coefficient.
The	three-dimensional 	distribution 	of	wing	lift
coefficient is given by Eq. B.21. Assuming that stall
occurs in a given wing section when that section lift
coefficient equals its maximum local lift coefficient
obtained from experimental data (Eq. B.9), we may define the
fuselage angle of attack for which stall occurs in section y
as
afs(y) = lclmax(y)-clo(y))/c^la(y)	 (B.36)
The wing section where stall initiates (at spanwise station
ys) is such that a fs(y) is minimum. It may be determined by
numerical minimization of a fs(y) with respect to y. The
resulting angle of attack may be used with Eq. B.25 to
determine the maximum sailplane lift coefficient CLmax'
This approach is described in Ref. 39. 	The cla(y)'
clo(y) and clmax(y) distributions are Reynolds number
dependent, as was pointed out earlier. 	Therefore, the
procedure should be repeated iteratively. Such a refinement
does not seem appropriate in view of the approximate
character of the method; the above mentioned distributions

B.4	SAILPLANE DRAG PREDICTION
B.4.1	Wing Drag
In this subsection, we develop expressions for the vortex

the total wing drag.
The local vortex induced drag coefficient is given in
Ref. 38 as
cdi(Y) = cl(Y)[a(Y)-c1(Y)/cla(Y)] 	 (B.37)
where the () emphasizes the fact that the vortex induced
drag coefficient c di and the lift coefficient c l include
finite span effects. Now, from Fig. 14
a(Y) = of+iw+Â£(Y)-aol(Y)	 (B.38)
The total drag distribution on the wing is
cd(Y) = cdi(Y)+cdp(Y)	 (B.39)
where the local airfoil profile drag coefficient c dp is
known once the local lift coefficient c l, the local
Reynolds number and the local thickness ratio are known, as
shown in Subsec. B.2.2.
The total drag on the wing is found as141Â°, :a.

It may be calculated once the flight speed, the fuselage

prove necessary to know the wing drag as a function of the
fuselage angle of attack. Using Eqs. B.11, B.21, and

the known weight (Eq. A.8). At this point, the

The drag polar is obtained point by point by repeating
this procedure for different lift coefficients. In this

the process must be repeated only three times to obtain the

GLOBAL STRUCTURAL SUBPROBLEM
The global structural subproblem objective is to design the
wing structure so as to achieve the total sailplane weight
specified in the performance subproblem. Once a weight is
chosen for the sailplane fuselage, tailplane, equipment and
pilot, the available weight for structural and non-
structural wing elements is known. The design variables of
this subproblem are the coefficients in the spanwise
distributions of weight and flexural 	and torsional
stiffnesses. The optimization is subjected to the
constraints that the wing tip deflection is limited in high
speed straight flight and that the torsional divergence
speed is beyond a set limit.
The wing shape and aerodynamic load parameters are
obtained from the aerodynamic subproblem. The wing flexural
and torsional responses are investigated using Rayleigh-Ritz
analyses. The redistribution of aerodynamic forces due to
the wing elastic deformations is neglected.
Optimization and sensitivity analysis require that
derivatives of the wing weight, tip displacement and
divergence dynamic pressure be calculated with respect to
the subproblem variables and parameters. Unless otherwise

C.2 GLOBAL STRUCTURAL LEVEL WING MODEL

To study the wing behavior at the global structural level,
we model it as a straight beam aligned with the previously
defined spanwise axis Y. We consider only two types of wing
deformations.164 	ORIGINAL PAGE 13
OF POOR QUAL6W
i)Bending deformations in a direction normal to the
wing mean aerodynamic chord, or, along axis N
defined in Subsec. B.5.3.
ii)Twisting deformations about the spanwise axis Y.
This neglects chordwise bending.
The parameters necessary to the description of the wing
global structural behavior are the distributions of bending
stiffness EI(y), torsional stiffness GJ(y) and total wing
weight (structural and non-structural) per unit length w(y).
It must be noted that the wing is made of composite material
as detailed in App. D. However the lay-ups are chosen so
that no bending-torsion coupling exists. Therefore, the
parameters retained will be adequate.
The distributions will be written as follows

These expressions are interpolations based on Lagrangian
polynomials (see Ref. 41). The EI i, GJi and w  are
stiffnesses and weight values at selected, equally spaced
stations y i along the wing. They are the design variables
of the global structural subproblem. They are collected in
vector X  and will be referred to as global stiffnesses.
C.2.2	Elastic Axis and Center of Gravitv Position
The structural model described in the previous subsection is
such that the elastic axis is assumed to lie on the spanwise
axis Y. Clearly, the elastic axis position depends directly
on the detailed wing design; it should be treated as a
reverse control (see Chap. 3). However, this control will
be ignored in a first approach to the design. It turns out
that this is probably a very reasonable assumption,
considering the detailed structural lay-out chosen (see App.
D).ORIGINAL 6 AGI i I::
166 	 OF POOR QUALITY
The position of a section center of gravity must be known
to properly account for the inertia forces. This is also a
reverse control. Initially, the mass center of gravity of a
wing section will be assumed at the area center of gravity
of that section, that is, at distances be from the section
leading edge and nc above the reference chord (see Subsec.
B.2.2).

C.3	STRUCTURAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
In order to obtain certification of an airplane by the
appropriate authorities, one must insure that the structure
is capable of withstanding a number of predetermined loading
conditions. Also, static and dynamic instabilities should
not occur within the flight envelope. Reference 40
describes the requirements set by the Federal Aviation
Agency (FAA) on sailplane designs. These requirements cover
stresses in load cases corresponding to symmetric or non-
symmetric flight conditions, towed flight and landing. Some
requirements also cover flutter. In addition to satisfying
the conditions set by the relevant regulating agency, the
designer may have to investigate loading conditions specific
to his own design. Clearly, a vast amount of calculation is168
required in the structural design phase of a project. While
modern optimization methods are perfectly capable of
handling multiple design conditions, it is preferable to
design the structure for a limited number of appropriately
selected load cases and instability modes. The resulting
design may then be checked for the remaining conditions and
optimization may be performed again with additional load
cases and instability modes, if desired.
In this work, the structure will be designed to satisfy
the three requirements described below.
i)Requirement 	1:	limit	out-of-plane 	bending.
Sailplane wings are typically long and flexible.
Excessive bending flexibility may result in control
surface jamming, inappropriate ground clearance
during landing or unsatisfactory dynamic behavior.
We therefore require that the wing tip deflection
be below a maximum limit utmax at an indicated
airspeed V t = 85 m/s, and a wing load factor nNw
1. Since the wing does not present bending-torsion
coupling, the constraint will control bending
stiffness and weight distributions.
ii)Requirement 2: limit stresses and preclude local
instabilities. 	To	size the details of the
structure (see App. D), we require that no failure169
occurs at a flight condition defined by n Nw = 5.33,
Vt = 100. m/s. This corresponds to a pull-up at
maximum authorized dive speed. This is a design
condition, therefore; an ultimate safety factor S 
= 1.5 must be used when calculating the ultimate
loads.
iii) Requirement 3: 	limit wing divergence dynamic
pressure. The FAA specifies that the sailplane
must be demonstrated "free of undesirable flight
characteristics for speeds below the dive speed"
(Vd). The maximum authorized dive speed for this
type of sailplane is about V  = 100 m/s. We
require that the wing divergence speed V D be such
that VD > 120. m/s. For straight wings with no
bending-torsion coupling, divergence is torsional
in nature. This constraint will therefore control
the torsional stiffness distribution.

LOCAL STRUCTURAL SUBPROBLEM
The task of the local structural subproblem is to find the
detailed design of the wing which corresponds to the
spanwise distributions of weight and stiffnesses chosen in
the global structural subproblem. The optimization is
subjected to the additional constraints that the stresses at
selected points in the structure do not exceed appropriate
allowables and that the various wing components be free of
buckling.
The wing is divided into equal length cylindrical
elements, each of which is optimized separately. The
overall element dimensions (length, chord, thickness) are
fixed by the aerodynamic subproblem. The global structural
subproblem imposes target values for the constant weight per
unit length and flexural and torsional stiffnesses. It also
supplies values for the out-of-plane shear force, bending
and twisting moments at the inboard section of the element
for stresses and stability calculations. The design
variables of the local structural subproblem are the
detailed element dimensions. The stresses and the panel
buckling loads are found using conventional design methods.

D.2	LOCAL STRUCTURAL LEVEL WING MODEL
D.2.1	Wing Construction
The wing construction is typical of present day technology
(see Refs. 42-43). It is a shell reinforced by a straight
spar normal to the plane of symmetry of the sailplane (Fig.
21). The spar caps are built of carbon fibers oriented
spanwise and resist most of the bending moment. The shells
as well as the spar webs are of symmetric sandwich made of
fiberglass face sheets with foam core. The glass fibers are
oriented at Â± 45 0 with respect to the spanwise direction,
thereby providing high shear stiffness.
Control surfaces (flaps/airbrake and aileron) run the
whole length of the trailing edge so that only the portion
of the wing between the leading edge and the rear web, the
torsion box, is capable of carrying load. Finally,
fiberglass ribs are positioned chordwise to increase the
buckling loads of the spar caps and the sandwich panels; the
rib thicknesses wild be held constant during optimization.188

D.2.2	Model Description
To conduct the design at the local level, we divide the
torsion box into n  equal length, cylindrical elements (Fig.
22). The chord length c, 4 and the maximum section thickness
t of each element are constant; together with the element
length b they are communicated to the local structural
subproblem from the aerodynamic subproblem in the vector H.i
(see Subsec. B.5.2). For each element, the design variables
are the spar cap width a and thickness t c, the leading and
trailing edge total thickness i s and face sheet thickness
tfs, the front and rear spar web total thickness t  and face
sheet thickness t fw, and the rib spacing d. Note that,
technically, the thicknesses of the composite lay-ups vary
in a discrete fashion since integer numbers of plies must be
used. Similarly, the rib spacing is a discrete quantity.
However, these will be treated as continuous variables to
avoid difficulties while optimizing the design.

D.3.1	Bendinq Moment Effect
The carbon fiber spar caps are about twenty times stiffer in
the spanwise direction than the fiberglass shells (Ref. 42)_
It is therefore legitimate to assume that the entire bending
moment is resisted by these spar caps. Furthermore, they
are symmetric and their thickness is small with respect to
the distance that separates them. Therefore, we assume them
to be subjected to a constant normal load per unit length
approximately given by

D.3.2	Shear Flow Distribution
Shear forces and twisting moments induce shear flows in the
panels constituting the wing section. Simple equilibrium
arguments (see Ref. 44) show that the shear flows are
constant on panels not subjected to normal edge loads and
linear on panels subjected to constant normal edge loads.N3192

Therefore, as summarized on Fig. 23, constant shear flows
exist on the leading edge shell (N 2), the trailing edge

D.5	CALCULATION OF STRESSES
D.S.1	General Procedure
The different fiber reinforced laminated panels constituting
the wing torsion box are of symmetric lay-ups. Furthermore,
they are assumed to be loaded by in-plane edge loads.
Therefore, their deformations entail only in-plane strains.
For each laminated panel (laminate) the strains are related
to the edge loads by'

The strain and load vectors (E,N) are given in a set of axes
called laminate axes (see Fig. 27). The laminate

of the n  layers constituting the laminate. The transformed
reduced stiffness matrix of a layer is dependent on the
characteristics of the material making up the layer and on
the orientation of the layer material axes with respect to
the laminate axes. General expressions for the Q  matrix
may be found in Ref. 45.

The stresses in the various layers may be determined from
Eqs. D.26-27, together with Eqs. D.29-30. They are in
material axes for the carbon fiber layers; for the
fiberglass layers, however, transformation D.28 must still
be used.
D.S.3	Stresses in the Sandwich Panels
A uniform state of stress exists in the sandwich panels
constituting the leading and trailing edge shells, as well
as the spar webs (see Fig. 23). 	Hence, the stresses need
only be monitored at the four points mentioned in Table 3213
(points 9 through 12). The sandwich core will be assumed
non-structural. In this case, the calculations of Subsec.
D.5.1 may be carried out quite simply. For the leading and
trailing edge shells, we have, in material axes
Nxy
al = -a2 = 2tfs
T12 = 0	(D.31)
while for the spar webs, t f s in Eq. D.31 should be replaced
by tfw
D.5.4	Failure Criterion
The states of stress described in the two previous
subsections are two-dimensional. Therefore, a failure
criterion must be used to determine whether a given loading
induces failure. Tsai-Wu's criterion reads (Ref. 45)6
al(01+XC-XT)+02(02+YC-YT)-	a102	+T12-1 <_ 0	(D.32)
XTXC	YTYC 	(XCXTY	1/2CYT)	S 2
where X  and X T are the material compressive and tensile
strengths along the fibers, Y  and Y T the corresponding
quantities across the fibers and S the in-plane shear
6 General formulations for Tsai-Wu's criterion usually
involve a strength biaxial tension test. Such a stress is	
difficult to determine accurately. 	In the formulation
chosen here, the need for that strength is alleviated by
specifying that Tsai-Wu's criterion reduces to Von Mise's
yield criterion when applied to an isotropic material.

strength. Failure will not occur in the wing section if
inequality D.32 is satisfied at all points defined in Table
3; there are twelve such conditions.
D.6	SECTION STABILITY
The stability of the wing box will be ascertained by
verifying the stability of each individual component. The
leading edge shell, which exhibits a strong curvature, will
be replaced by two flat panels. because of the model cross-
section symmetry and the nature of the system of induced
loads (Fig. 23), only seven panels need be considered; they
are numbered as shown on Fig. 28. Two different buckling
problems must be solved:
i)Buckling of orthotropic sandwich panels under in-
plane shear (panels 1 through S).
ii)Buckling of orthotropic composite panels under in-
plane compression and shear (spar caps, panels 6
and 7).
These problems are discussed in the following subsections.
D.6.1	Sandwich Panels Bucklin
The sandwich panels constituting the wing torsion box are
primarily loaded in shear. This subsection is concerned
with the calculation of the critical load of orthotropic215

16. Abstract 	This	report describes an optimization approach to the design of complex 	engi-
neering	systems.	The approach assumes a decomposition of the original 	problem	(design
of the system) 	into smaller subproblems 	(design of subsystems) organized in a multilevel
hierarchy.
A general 	algorithm is 	proposed which carries out the design process iteratively,
starting at the top of the hierarchy and proceeding downward. 	Each subproblem is
optimized separately for fixed controls from higher level 	subproblems. 	An optimum
sensitivity analysis 	is then performed which determines the sensitivity of the sub-
problem design 	to	changes	in	higher	level	subproblem controls. 	The resulting 	sensitivity
derivatives are used to construct constraints which force the controlling subproblems
into chosing their own designs so as to improve the lower level 	subproblem designs while
satisfying their own constraints.
The applicability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by devising a four-level
hierarchy to perform the simultaneous aerodynamic and structural 	design of a high-
performance sailplane wing for maximum cross-country speed. 	Finally, the concepts
discussed are applied to the two-level 	minimum weight structural 	design of the sailplane
wing.	The numerical 	experiments show that discontinuities 	in the sensitivity deriva-
tives may delay convergence, 	but that the algorithm is robust enough to overcome these
discontinuities and produce low-weight feasible designs, 	regardless of whether the
optimization 	is started from the feasible space or the infeasible one.
